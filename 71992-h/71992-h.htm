<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
  "HUSH!  DO YOU HEAR THAT CRY?<br>
  WHAT CAN IT BE?"<br>
</h3>

<p>
There is no more beautiful bay than that
of Methlin on all the wild west shores of
Scotland; there is no quainter or more
old-fashioned little town than the fishing
village that clusters around its shores, its
wee little whitewashed cottages half hidden
in the green of waving elders and drooping silver birch
trees.  Behind the village is a wealth of woodland,
stretching for miles away up the valley, between hills
so high that at sunrise they cast their darkling
shadows far across the sea.
</p>

<p>
But our story opens at eventide.  The sun has
already gone down behind the waves, leaving a sky
and sea of such gorgeous and startling colours&mdash;such a
mad mixture of crimson, orange, purple, and grey&mdash;as
never surely was seen on artist's canvas.
</p>

<p>
And not only from the water, but even from the
wide expanse of wet sand, are these colours reflected.
</p>

<p>
The sea is very calm, yet the Atlantic Ocean, that
swells and heaves and breaks along this coast, never
falls quite asleep; and if you glance to-night across
the sands at the far-receding tide, you may note long
moving lines of orange, and hear the gentle boom of
the breaking wavelets.
</p>

<p>
Right in the centre of this mixed mass of radiant
light and colour&mdash;darkling against it, and throwing
long shadows on the wet flat beach&mdash;are two figures.
How tall they look!  Yes; but they are but boy and
girl.  Even the sea-gulls that run across the sands
appear gigantic birds in that painted haze.  Children
both they are; he but ten, and she but six.
</p>

<p>
In looking seaward there is something else one will
not fail to note; namely, a long dark wall of rocks,
forming the southern horn of the bay, and running
straight out into the ocean a mile and more.
</p>

<p>
There are a few fishing-boats drawn up upon the
beach, and this is all the view.
</p>

<p>
Young though they are, both Fred Arundel and his
foster-sister Toddie must be impressed by the solemnity
and beauty of the scene, for they are unusually silent,
as hand in hand they come homewards across the
soloured sands.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly they start, and stop and listen.
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Toddie!  Did you hear that cry?  What
can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Only a Tatywake, Fled."
</p>

<p>
"No, Todd, it was no Kittywake.  It was no bird at
all Hark!  There it is again."
</p>

<p>
Yes; borne towards the beach on the evening breeze,
and falling on their listening ears, comes once again a
faint but plaintive cry, that anyone less a child of the
ocean than Fred, might well have mistaken for the
scream of some sea-bird, a gull, or tern, or skua.
</p>

<p>
Toddie clung fearfully to Fred now.
</p>

<p>
"O Fleddie," she cried, "I is so flightened.  What
is it?  Some poor man dlowning out there all by his
self.  Yun home, Fled, and tell daddy.  O Fleddie,
yun, yun!"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Fred boldly.  "Whoever it is, must be
clinging to the rocks.  The tide is rising fast, Todd;
but the little cobble is handy, and I'll pull out and see."
</p>

<p>
"And I must come too," insisted Toddie.
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Fred.  "I'll ship the tiller, and you
can steer."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'll teer, Fled.  Oh, be twick!"
</p>

<p>
Fred was quick; no boy could have been quicker;
and in less than five minutes, impelled by his strong
young arms, the cobble was bounding over the rising
tide.
</p>

<p>
Fred had got wet to the waist in launching the boat,
but he did not mind that.  Something told him there
was a precious life to be saved, and he could think of
nothing else.
</p>

<p>
For fully half a mile straight out to the sea ran the
rocks and cliffs, ending in a bold and rocky promontory
nearly seven hundred feet in height.
</p>

<p>
Bight along by the rocks rowed Fred, Toddie grasping
the tiller in her tiny hands, her anxious, pretty face
strained with listening.
</p>

<p>
Every now and then Fred rested on his oars for a
few moments to listen, and ever as he did so, rising
high over the screaming of the gulls, they could hear
that piteous cry for help.
</p>

<p>
Quicker and quicker now rowed Fred.  He was a
good oar, and was warming to his work.  No extra
finish was there about Fred's rowing, no feathering of
oars or any such folly, but a long pull and a strong
pull, dipping his blades into the water deep enough to
get good purchase, but not an inch deeper, and bending
well to every stroke.  Right steadily too the lad rowed,
so that verily there was music and rhythm 'twixt
rowlock and oar.
</p>

<p>
The clouds had lost their gorgeous colours, and from
a rift of blue on the eastern sky one single star looked
down.
</p>

<p>
Night was coming on apace, and there was not
wanting evidence that it would be a stormy one.  The
swell was rising high out here, the surging seas broke
white against the cliff foot, and little angry catspaws
were already ruffling the water.
</p>

<p>
Fred rested on his oars and listened once more.
</p>

<p>
All was still.  The wandering sea-birds wheeled
near and shrieked their dismal shriek, but no human
sound could the children hear.
</p>

<p>
Fred himself began to get frightened now.  The
silence was like the silence of death, and even the
voices of the birds had a ghostly ring in them.  Was
it all over then?
</p>

<p>
No; for even at that moment Fred's quick ear
caught the sound of something moving in the water.
</p>

<p>
"Look! look!" cried Toddie.  "A seal, Fled, coming
this way all by his self."
</p>

<p>
Yes, there was a black head yonder, coming rapidly
on towards the boat.
</p>

<p>
Fred quickly shipped his oars now, and stood by to
give assistance; for he soon discovered that the black
head was human, the face pale and startled-looking.
</p>

<p>
Presently the swimmer stopped, and trode water not
four yards away from the boat's bow.
</p>

<p>
"Please were you co-co-coming for m-m-m-me?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course," cried Fred.  "What else?  Swim nearer
and I'll help you up.  Mind, Toddie, we don't
capsize."
</p>

<p>
Toddie held the helm grimly amidships, and sat on
the gunwale, and in a moment more Fred had pulled a
lad apparently a year or so older than himself in over
the bows.
</p>

<p>
A tallish, gentlemanly-looking boy, dressed in a
dripping kilt, and with a strongly English accent.
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully go-go-good of you," he began.  "Oh,"
he added, "you have a li-li-little la-la-lady on board.
Good evening, m-m-miss.  The tide was r-r-rising over
the rocks, and soon would have drowned me."
</p>

<p>
Then he raised his hand as if to pull his cap off, but
there was no cap there.
</p>

<p>
"I do-do-don't s-s-stutter, mind," he said, "it is only
the co-co-cold."
</p>

<p>
And Toddie felt she could have cried for this handsome
boy, whose teeth were chattering in his head.
</p>

<p>
"Mammy Mop will soon wa'm oo," said Toddie
consolingly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thanks!  And may I take an oar?  Thanks
awfully."
</p>

<p>
Before the boys had beached the boat and hauled
her up the stranger had quite recovered his speech.
</p>

<p>
"I can never thank you enough," he said, "for
rescuing me from what would have been a watery
grave."
</p>

<p>
"Give me oo hand now," said Toddie.  "We will all
yun home, and oo can tell the stoly to Mammy Mop."
</p>

<p>
"But really I mustn't&mdash;&mdash;," began the boy.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing else for it, however; for Fred had
seized his other hand, and between Toddie and him
they ran him right up the beach, along the road a little
way, and through a bonnie garden, towards the door of
a cottage, the light from which was streaming out into
the gloom of the falling night.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour afterwards, had you peeped in through
the four-paned window of the fisherman's cottage, this
is what you would have seen: A bright and cheerful
fire of peat and wood burning on a low hearth, a pot
with a steaming and savoury stew in it hanging from a
soot-blackened chain above it; in one corner, sitting in
an old-fashioned high-backed chair, a tall and elderly
man, with finely-chiselled features, long hair floating
over his jersey, an almost wild look in his eyes, but
kindness in every lineament nevertheless.  This is
Papa Pop, and on his knee sits Toddie, one arm round
his neck, but her great wondering blue eyes fixed on
the face of that handsome English-looking boy, who,
to her way of thinking, seems like the prince of some
fairy tale, suddenly dropped out of the clouds.  In the
other corner sits Fred himself, and at his feet a sonsy
cat and a dachshund dog.
</p>

<p>
Standing on the floor behind this group is the
fisherman's wife, tall and bony, rough, but kindly-looking
withal, and in front of her, with the firelight streaming
on his strangely uncouth face, is Bunko, the fool of
the village.
</p>

<p>
But "fool" is too harsh a word to use; for although
but half-witted, there is a deal of sense and shrewdness
under that towsy mop of his.  Bunko holds in one
hand a rough stick or pole higher than himself.  This
is his rod of office; for Bunko takes all the village
cows away to the hills every morning, and besides this
he does all kinds of odd jobs that few save he could
accomplish.
</p>

<p>
"Weel, Bunko," the fisherman's wife is saying as
she crams his pocket with buttered scones, "you'll
tak' the road right over the hills."
</p>

<p>
"Umphm!" says Bunko.
</p>

<p>
"And ten miles and a bittock will bring ye to
the hoose o' Benshee.  Knock at the door&mdash;d'ye
understan'?"
</p>

<p>
"Fine that."
</p>

<p>
"And tell the laird's folk that Master Fielding is
safe for the nicht at&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Bunko strode across the floor and laid a huge red
hand on the young stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Master Fielding&mdash;that's this wee blinker, isn't it
noo?"
</p>

<p>
The lad laughed, and put something in Bunko's
hand.  Bunko looked at the coin.
</p>

<p>
"A bonnie white shillin'!" he cried.  "Hurrah!
Noo I tell ye, sirs, the grass winna grow aneath
poor Bunko's feet till he's at Benshee-house and back
again.  Keelie, laddie, whaur are you?"
</p>

<p>
A wall-eyed collie dog sprang up at the summons.
Bunko struck his pole once on the floor, then he and
Keelie went out into the darkness, and were seen no
more that night.
</p>

<p>
"I really ought to have gone with Bunko," said
Frank Fielding, for that was the stranger's name.
"But it doesn't matter much," he added, "only mamma
will be quite pleased to hear of our adventure.  Fred,
you will be a hero, and Miss Toddie a heroine.  For
mamma is very romantic.  And I'm sure, Fred, I'll
never forget it.  I had been fishing, sir"&mdash;he was
addressing the old fisherman now&mdash;"and was overtaken
by the tide.  It was very dreadful with the night
coming on, and the sea birds moaning and screaming
around that cold grey rock, and the water rising,
rising, rising.  Heigho! it would soon have covered
me; so you see, Miss Toddie, you saved my life."
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied little Miss Consequential, "when oo
says oo players to-night, of tourse oo'll thank the
dood Lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Toddie, I must," said Frank with a little sigh.
Well might he sigh!  Prayers in the family circle
were unknown at Benshee Hall.
</p>

<p>
Frank was already strangely interested in the
inmates of this little cot, and when Mammy Mop, as
the children called her, handed down the great old
Bible, and when this brown-faced fisherman read a
portion, and afterwards prayed more earnestly and
in loftier language than ever the parish minister used,
Frank looked at him in reverent wonder not unmixed
with awe.
</p>

<p>
Then they all sat round the fire again.
</p>

<p>
The wind had now risen and was moaning round
the cot, and the rain rattled dismally against it.
</p>

<p>
Fred shuddered a little as he listened to the wind.
</p>

<p>
"I'm so glad," he said, "that we went down to-night
to our aquarium, to feed the blennies, and a new pet
of Toddie's that she called Tom."
</p>

<p>
"Tom has been naughty," said Toddie, "so Tom has
been sent home."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that is true," said Fred, "very naughty, and
we had gone down to the rocks to put Tom away, else
we never should have heard your cry."
</p>

<p>
The children's aquarium, I may tell you, was a
marine one in a cave down by the sea.  The cave
was a shallow one in the south side of the ridge of
high cliffs that ran out to sea, but far removed
beyond the avaricious clutch of a rising tide unless
something out of the common should occur.  Bodily
the sea had never risen so high as Fred's cave in his
time, although in days of storm and tempest, when
great green waves broke and thundered on the beach,
the spray was often carried far along the face of the
cliffs with force enough to drench anyone to the skin
who ventured as far as the cave; once inside, however,
one was safe enough.  Not more than ten feet in depth
or width was the cave, though more than nearly twenty
feet high, and a very pleasant place to spend an hour
or two in by day during the summer months.  At noon
the sun shone right into it, and penetrated the water
of Fred's aquarium at the end.  This latter was a
natural basin in the rock, a kind of hollow shelf about
three feet above the floor, which these children kept
filled with water, and stocked with many curious
creatures, that they found upon the beach, such as
shell fish, tiny medus√¶, sea anemones, and little fishes
of many kinds.  Toddie delighted in droll, weird-looking
water things, and used to shout aloud for joy when
she found any new form of youthful marine monster
left in a pool of the rocks when the tide went back.
She never went seawards without Fred, and he carried
a little hand landing-net, and whenever a fresh specimen
was discovered ugly enough to commend itself to Toddie,
she peremptorily ordered her chaperon to fish it out
and convey it to the cave aquarium.
</p>

<p>
Things throve here very well indeed, owing perhapa
to the fact that they kept the water constantly changed
and carefully removed any wee creature that died.
Singularly enough, however, soon after the arrival
of Tom, specimens began to disappear in the most mysterious manner.
</p>

<p>
But it is time to explain who Tom was.  Watching
the fishermen drawing in their nets one day, in which
was a goodly quantity of bonnie silver herrings,
Toddie noticed one of the men pull a strange-looking
fish out of the net and throw it inland to die.  Toddie
went straight away after it.  The creature had fallen
among a lot of dry seaweed, so it was none the worse,
though it wriggled alarmingly when the girl lifted it
up and put it in her apron.  In ten minutes' time she
had placed it in Fred's cave aquarium, where it rested
on its side a short time, then began a tour of inspection
much to Toddie's delight.  A long stone-grey,
light-spotted thing, with a semicircular mouth away under
its chin, and a tail with one half of it much longer
than the other.  In fact it was that species of small
shark that abounds round British coasts, called the
dog-fish.
</p>

<p>
Toddie and Fred had determined to make a great
pet of it, so they fed it on sand-hoppers and earthworms,
and bait generally.  Tom ate everything they
gave him greedily enough, and seemed to look for more.
</p>

<p>
But since his arrival the other specimens began to
disappear, and the pretty little sea-minnows, as Fred
called them, that had been placed beside Tom to keep
him company, had gone also.
</p>

<p>
On this evening when Fred and Toddie had gone to
the cave they found Tom waiting expectantly.
</p>

<p>
I'm afraid Tom was a very sly fish.
</p>

<p>
"Just look at me now," he seemed to say, as he
gazed at them with that slit of an eye of his, "you see
before you one of the most innocent and kind-hearted
trouts in all creation.  To be sure my shape is rather
against me, and so is my colour; but for all that I'm
the most gentle and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
It is a pity that at this very instant the last
newcomer, a sea-minnow, should have darted out from
under a bit of sea-weed, and sailed to the front.
</p>

<p>
All Tom's virtue and goodness were forgotten in a
moment.  He quivered all over from stem to stern, his
very eyes appeared to flash fire.  Next moment he had
thrown himself on his side, the water rippled, the
sea-minnow was gone at a snap.
</p>

<p>
Toddie threw up her hands and screamed.  Fred
stood firm.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think of that, Todd?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Tom, Tom," cried Toddie, "you naughty dolly
fish!"
</p>

<p>
"It was all a mistake I assure you," Tom seemed to
say.  "I opened my mouth to yawn, you know, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fred!  Fred!" said Toddie, "tatch that naughty
Tom and put him in the sea."
</p>

<p>
So Tom's doom was sealed at once.
</p>

<p>
He was caught, therefore, in the landing-net, carried
away to the deeper water close by the rocks, and
dropped into the sea.
</p>

<p>
And that was the last Toddie saw of her "dolly-fish."
</p>

<p>
"And now," said Frank, addressing Eean, "I know
you have a story to tell.  Do tell it, sir, and make it as
dreadful as possible."
</p>

<p>
The fisherman laughed as he looked at Frank.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think," he said, "I must tell you anything
very terrible; but if I tell you a story, I promise you
it shall be a true one.  And a true story is better than
a terrible one.  Ahem!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
"BUT LOOKING BACK, BOYS, IT IS ALL LIKE A DREAM."
</h3>

<p>
Was it a gleam of pleasure, or the flush from
the firelight, that spread over old Eean's
face as Frank Fielding made his quiet but
ingenuous request, to be favoured with a
story?
</p>

<p>
The fisherman smiled, and now the
rugged lineaments of his face softened wonderfully.
He did not answer directly, however.
</p>

<p>
Eppie, his wife, had drawn near to the circle round
the fire with her great black spinning-wheel, and it
was towards her that Eean turned.  Surely too it was
for her that smile was intended.
</p>

<p>
He stretched out his left arm, the one that was
nearest to his wife, and laid his hand on her lap.
There was something very touching in this simple act,
and in the tender look that accompanied it.  For a
moment or two the birring of the spinning-wheel
ceased as Eppie took her husband's hand in both of
hers.
</p>

<p>
He had really asked a question, though not in words;
but it was in words that Eppie replied.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Eean, yes," she said.  "What for no tell the
story?"
</p>

<p>
"Our story, Eppie."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, our story, Eean."
</p>

<p>
Birr&mdash;rr&mdash;rr went the spinning-wheel again; and
I'm not sure there was not some moisture in Eppie's
eyes as she bent once more over her work.
</p>

<p>
It was a very old-fashioned pipe of clay that Eean
now lit with a morsel of burning peat, and when he
got it to go he placed over the bowl the white iron
lid which was attached by a tiny chain to the stalk.
Then he leaned back in his chair, and for a time
seemed intent only on watching the blue rings of
smoke, that went curling up towards the blackened
rafters of the humble cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Boys, boys," he said slowly at last, "it is a long,
long time ago since my real life-story began.  Thirty
years and over, lads.  Is that not so, Eppie?"
</p>

<p>
Birr&mdash;rr&mdash;rr! went the spinning-wheel.
</p>

<p>
"Imphm," assented Eppie.
</p>

<p>
"But go on, Eean," she continued; "and if ye ravel
in the thread o' your discoorse, I'll try to pit ye
straight again."
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged, Eean took a few more pulls at his
pipe and went on.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty years seem a long time to look forward to;
but looking back, boys, why it's all like a dream.
Yet, my lads, life has no business to be a dream.
'Life is real, life is earnest,' as the hymn says; and if
your eyes don't open before you are out of your teens,
I tell you this, it is a poor look out for you in
after-life.
</p>

<p>
"I notice a weary kind of a light in your eyes,
young Master Frank.  I know what you're thinking:
'The old man is not telling a story, he's only
preaching.'  But the ways of old men must be borne with.  So
patience for a moment, boy; patience!
</p>

<p>
"I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.  Oh,
not a big one, I assure you!  But I knew right well
that when twenty-one I should have a few thousands
to begin life with; and it was this very knowledge, I
believe, that made me careless and a dreamer.
</p>

<p>
"My father was a Highlander, like myself.  He <i>had</i>
been rich, but he had also been a soldier, and squandered
all his own money, though he retired on half-pay with
fame and glory; for on many a blood-red field in India
his sword had rang and clashed, and his slogan been
heard wherever the battle raged the fiercest.
</p>

<p>
"That was my father, and I was his only son.  I
had a dear mother that doted on me, and could scarcely
bear to have me out of her sight.  She would have me
to be a child even when I was seventeen years of age.
I tell you that up till that age I did nothing on earth
but dream my life away.  I was to be something great
<i>in futuro</i>.  There was a castle building for me
somewhere, in which I should live when a man.  The good
fairies were building it, I suppose; but woe is me,
boys, fairy promises are but like soap-bubbles that rise
and float on the soft summer air, all glitter and beauty,
then&mdash;burst.
</p>

<p>
"I was a poet in those days&mdash;they tell me I am a
bard still&mdash;but I fear my verses have lost the fire and
frenzy of youth.  Never mind, in those dear foolish
days I learned nothing that was not pleasant, I did
nothing I could not find pleasure in.  With gun on
shoulder I used to start for the hill.  Too often my
gun was thrown on the heather, and I lay down beside
it in the sun to versify and dream.  Or I might take
my fishing-rod, and with my dog Kooran at my heels,
set off for the lonesome tarn or mountain burn; but,
ah, me! the fish seldom rose to my flies, and the
streamlet sang to me, and I to the streamlet&mdash;there was
music in everything around me, in the sailing clouds,
in the waving broom, the drooping birch-trees and
dark solemn pines themselves.
</p>

<p>
"Did my conscience never tell me I was doing wrong?
It did at times.  There were moments when the stern
realities of life used to force themselves upon my
thoughts.  Surely man was made and meant for
something better than to be an idle dreamer.  Then I
would start and awake as if from a lethargy.  I would
look around me, and even blush to see all men busy
but myself, all creatures toiling, yet all, all happier
even than I.
</p>

<p>
"What should I be?  What should I be?  How often
the question would keep recurring to my mind.  Be a
soldier like my father?  No, I cared not for camps and
fighting.  Be a sailor, and go sailing over the world.
Yes, that was better; but the work, it was the work I
feared.  To sail on, on, on, for ever over sunlit summer
seas would have suited me.  But seas are not always
sunlit, and storms arise, and&mdash;no, I would not be a
sailor.
</p>

<p>
"Why not live to sing as Byron, Ossian, and Burns had
done?  But I must have some one else save the birds
and streams and trees to sing to.  Then a gloomy spell
came over the spirit of my dream, and I thought
myself the most miserable of all created beings.  The
linnet that sang among the golden furze, his nest not
far away, seemed to laugh at me.  The linnet had love.
The wild deer in the forest shook their antlered heads,
and appeared to despise me in my forlornness, they
were as happy as the summer's day was glad and long.
The eagle that floated high above the clouds mocked
me.  He could soar.  Oh, how I wished and wanted
to soar!  Everything too about me was so lovely, I
had a poet's eye for beauty.  Even the metallic lustre
on the beetles that crept through the grass shot rays of
pleasure to my heart.  'Was it possible,' I said to myself
one day, as I lounged by a river side.  'Was it possible
for me to transfer some of the beauty I saw around me
to canvas?  Why not?  Others have done so.  I had
been to the great city of London, I had revelled in
picture-galleries, all the memory of pictures I had seen
came back to me now with a force I had never felt
before.  Hurrah!' I shouted, starting up, 'I will be
an artist.  I will build my own castles.  Away, fairies,
away I'll dream no more.  I'll be a man.  I am a man.'
</p>

<p>
"My poor dog must have thought I'd gone mad.  I
broke my fishing-rod across my knee and flung it far
into the dark brown stream, and once more shouted till
the wild coneys fled into their holes on the cairney hill
sides.
</p>

<p>
"No, my mother did not object; I should have the
best of teachers; the best of teaching; I should go to
London; go to Rome.  My pictures should be hung, I'd
make wealth and fame, her darling boy should be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Here old Eean paused for a moment.  He shook the
ashes from his pipe with a gesture almost of anger.
</p>

<p>
"Dreams!  Dreams!  Dreams!" he muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Boys, I had not learned the art of application early
enough in youth, I was thoughtless, my dear mother
said in excuse for me, and thoughtlessness was natural
to youth.
</p>

<p>
"But, oh, lads, listen!  Thoughtlessness is not, should
not be, natural to youths.  Life's stern battle is all
before them; should they be thoughtless or careless as
they gird up their loins to meet the foe?  Life's stormy
ocean is rolling resistlessly on towards their frail barques;
how shall they mount those heaving seas, how fight
against wind and tempest, if they trust all to blind
chance?  I tell you what&mdash;and he who tells you knows&mdash;that
thoughtfulness must be your guide to every
good in life; ay, and to the world beyond as well,
Oh, my dear lads, grasp these truths, and never, never
forget them!  Act on them too, and they will make
you men, yes, heroes.
</p>

<p>
"But I am preaching now.  Forgive me, and my
tale&mdash;alas! it is an all too common one as far as it regards
myself&mdash;shall soon be told.
</p>

<p>
"I was not by any means what is called a wild youth,
while pursuing my studies under masters in London,
and elsewhere: the ordinary and sinful frivolities of
youths about town had no charm for me.  I loathed
them, and despised the empty-headed fools who gave
way to them.  I did not quarrel with these men, I
simply avoided them.  I preferred my own company
to theirs, and my own thoughts.  I was often to be
seen alone at the play, or opera, or alone in the picture
galleries.  It was a pity for me I did not visit the
latter in company with art critics, but I had found out
that some of these were lacking not only in knowledge
but in honesty, so I avoided them all, as a child who
has been burned fears flame in any and every form.
</p>

<p>
"Did I work well?  I worked fairly well.  My fault,
and it is a radical one, was, that I was in too great a
hurry to be a painter&mdash;the rudiments of drawing were
to me a weary task.  Like a boy I gloated over colour
and effect.  But I had one picture hung.  Oh, bless
that day for just one reason&mdash;it made my poor dear
mother happy!  When she received the letter in which
I announced my success, she shed more tears over it
than if the missive had been one announcing the death
of a dear friend.  Yes, they were tears of joy.
</p>

<p>
"Did my single success have a good effect on me?
Alas! no, the very reverse.  I fancied myself&mdash;fool
that I was&mdash;upon a mountain top of fame and glory.
High up among the rosy clouds of sunrise, with all the
world at my feet.  I determined to do no more work
for a time, not genuine study at least&mdash;I should set
out on a grand walking tour!  What a happy idea I
thought this was!  Mind you, I still was the poet at
heart, and Nature in every form still appealed to me.
I had come to hate my sky-high studio in London, the
dusty winding stairs that led to it, its furniture and
furnishings, and even the outlook from its windows.
</p>

<p>
"I was like a boy while preparing for this grand
tour.  For more than a week my time by day was
occupied in shopping.  All my purchases might soon
have been made had I been content with the ordinary
outfit of a walking artist.  But this would not suit my
vanity.  I believe I was a rather handsome young man
then.  Was I not, Eppie?"
</p>

<p>
Birr-rr-rr went the wheel.  No word came from
Eppie, only a smile lit up her face for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"So," continued Eean, "I determined to take heavy
baggage as well as a knapsack and cudgel.  This I
would arrange to be sent on by train or coach.  Guns,
fishing-rod and tackle, books, the best of novels, the
best of poets, I even took dress suits.  Yes, boys, I
feel ashamed now when I think of it, but my vanity
led me to believe that I should be f√™ted and feasted at
the houses of the wealthy.
</p>

<p>
"Away I went, and for many weeks of wandering
I was truly happy.  I worked too by fits and starts,
and my portfolios were getting filled with pretty bits
that I culled upon my rambles.  I had not yet found
out, nor could I have believed, that rural England was
so charmingly sweet and pretty.  No great wonder
that I lingered therein for months and months.  True,
my dress suits were never once taken out from the
trunk that contained them, nor was any squire or
nobleman ever likely, I began to think, to invite the
wandering artist to dinner or give him even a day's
fishing or shooting.  Was this fame then?  Surely
everyone had heard of the rising artist who had had a
picture hung.  And prettily criticised too.  Well, I
did not break my heart.  I ate my humble meals and
slept at village inns, and if I was taken for anything
at all by the villagers, it was either for 'a kind of
surveyor,' a 'strolling sign painter,' or 'something in
tea.'
</p>

<p>
"But during these long rambles there had been the
glamour of spring, and the glory of summer, over all
the land, and I was contented and happy.
</p>

<p>
"I hardly ever thought of writing even, wicked that
I was, to my mother.  But when at last the summer
commenced, and I saw one day a pale yellow splash
of foliage on a green ash tree, as if some tint of last
night's sunset had fallen on it and lingered there, I
bethought me of the purple and crimson heather on
the bonnie Highland hills of my wild native land.
And in a week's time I was home at my father's house.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I had been working hard, I told my mother.
</p>

<p>
"'I know,' she said, 'and I expected to see you wan
and pale, dear boy, instead of rosy red.'
</p>

<p>
"Then I told her all&mdash;where I had been, and spread
out before her my portfolios of crude unfinished bits.
</p>

<p>
"'They will work up, and work into noble pictures
when I return to town,' I said.
</p>

<p>
"It was thus I deceived myself and her.
</p>

<p>
"I next set out to study the beauties of hill scenery
of straths and glens, of loch and stream and torrent,
of weird pine forests, far in the depths of rugged
mountain passes, of sheep and shepherds' shielings, and
of everything that makes up the stern silent grandeur
of the Scottish Highlands.
</p>

<p>
"One day I found myself seated high up the glen
here with the reek of this same wee village rising blue
above the birchen trees, with the great Atlantic Ocean
sobbing on the sandy beach, or breaking into whitest
foam against that long ridge of darkest rock that runs
westward yonder to meet and welcome the rolling seas.
There were white clouds afloat in the sky's blue, there
were white sails dotting the blue of the sea, there was
the buzz of insect life in the heather all around me,
and the afternoon was warm and soft.  Had I fallen
asleep I wonder?  I know not.  But I started up at
last inspired with a new idea.
</p>

<p>
"It was an idea that made my cheeks tingle with
pleasurable emotion.
</p>

<p>
"I should write a book, a book that would make me
famous.  I should in this book wed together the harp
and the easel, the thistle and the rose.
</p>

<p>
"Let me explain to you, boys, for I can see you
hardly catch my meaning.  The book, then, was to
embrace both poetry and painting, the wild songs I
should sing of my own mountain land; the illustrations
all from my own pencil and brush, hence <i>The Harp
and the Easel</i>.  But the scenery should be touches from
Nature in both Scotland and England, hence the title
of <i>The Thistle and the Rose</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I went down the mountain side at the rush,
vaulting as vaults the deer, so strong, so well, so happy
was I that my very feet seemed to spurn the turf on
which I trode.
</p>

<p>
"But was it turf?  No, surely it was air.  So filled
with the inspiration of my grand idea was I, that
I appeared no longer on earth or even belonging
to it.
</p>

<p>
"Boys, these last words of mine contain a grim kind
of a joke which you will at once see.  I made just one
vault too many, then I was indeed walking on air, and
no longer on earth.  I was falling, falling, falling!  Oh,
it did seem such a long, long time ere I reached the
foot of that rocky cliff!  Then all was a blank.
</p>

<p>
"I had fallen as it were into sudden darkness, and
but for a pine-tree on which I bad luckily alighted,
and which lowered me earthward all torn and bleeding,
it might have been the darkness of death.
</p>

<p>
"Eppie, wife, heap more peats upon the fire and stir
the blazing drift-wood.  Listen, lads, to the moaning
wind; surely that is hail that rattles so against the
panes.  Frank, it is well you haven't to make your way
through moor and forest to-night with Bunko."
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't have minded being with poor Bunko,
sir, I assure you, because I like to be out in storms;
but then I could not have heard the conclusion of
your story."
</p>

<p>
"And must I conclude to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir, yes!  You're just coming to the best of it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, boys, well," said the old bard, "you must be
humoured."

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
AN AIMLESS LIFE&mdash;PEACE AT LAST.
</h3>

<p>
"The darkness seemed to lift at last, and I
gradually became sensible.  Everything
around me was hazy for a time&mdash;a kind
of a gauze curtain seemed to hang 'twixt
me and as pretty a rustic picture as I ever
yet had seen.
</p>

<p>
"I was not lying at the cliff foot, I was in a soft,
warm bed, all hung round with snow-white curtains.
It was so near the gloaming hour that I could see the
firelight dancing on the plain deal furniture, and on
the pictures of ships and boats that hung on the
whitewashed wall.  There was a stuffed sea-gull in a
case, and the model of a fishing-boat also under glass,
and on a little table a big ha' Bible and other devotional
books, surmounted by a vase of freshly-culled wild
flowers.  Then I turned my aching eyes towards the
little window, prettily festooned with curtains of
dimity, and on the sill of which pot-flowers were
growing, the red radiance of sunset lighting up and
strangely altering the green of their leaves.  But my
eyes fell on a picture of a different sort at the same
time: a young girl seated by the window sewing, her
head bent towards the white seam, her dark hair half
hiding a face that to me was as lovely as an angel's.
</p>

<p>
"Some movement on my part caused her to glance
towards the bed, and seeing me awake she put down
her work and came towards me.
</p>

<p>
"'Where am I?' I asked faintly.
</p>

<p>
"She put her fingers on my lips.
</p>

<p>
"'You are where ye maun lie,' she said, smiling,
though I'm sure there were tears in her eyes; 'where
ye maun lie till well, but ye must not speak.'
</p>

<p>
"Poor, simple lassie!  I knew then as I knew after
that she was doing her best to talk in English, though
far dearer to me was the expressive language of Burns
the poet.
</p>

<p>
"She now put something to my lips in a spoon.  I
drank, and slumbered again.
</p>

<p>
"When once more conscious, there stood the village
doctor, and an old, white-haired, pleasant-faced dame
in a fisher's cap.
</p>

<p>
"'Will he live, doctor?'
</p>

<p>
"'Live! yes, if he has plenty of good nursing.'
</p>

<p>
"'He'll want for naething here, puir laddie, that we
can gie him.  Ech, sir, but I'm thankful.'
</p>

<p>
"My young nurse was not there, so I slept for a
time, and when I awoke she sat there again.
</p>

<p>
"'May I talk just a little?'
</p>

<p>
"'Yes, just a little,' she said.  'Tell me,' she added,
'who your people are, because ye ken they must be
told?'
</p>

<p>
"'Plenty of time.  Plenty of time,' I murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Then bit by bit I told her all my story.
</p>

<p>
"'I would rather,' I said, 'my mother knew nothing
till I am up and about.'
</p>

<p>
"'But will she not be&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"'No, no, child,' I said.  'She is used to my wandering
ways, and oftentimes I do not write for months.'
</p>

<p>
"'Isn't that unkind?'
</p>

<p>
"'I fear so,' I said.
</p>

<p>
"'Are you <i>good</i>?' she asked pointedly.
</p>

<p>
"'Not too good I fear.'
</p>

<p>
"'D' ye say your prayers nicht and mornin'?  Had
ye said your prayers on that day ye fell o'er that
fearfu' cliff?'
</p>

<p>
"I was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Only a simple Scotch lassie would have preached
to me thus.  But she looked so saint-like as she sat
there, gazing almost mournfully at me with her calm,
tender grey eyes, that really I was thinking then more
of painting her in a subject than anything else.
</p>

<p>
"'No,' I said at last, 'I am not good as you
understand it, but you shall teach me.'
</p>

<p>
"'The way of transgressors is hard,' said the little
Puritan; 'but oh, sir, the plan o' salvation is sae simple
a bairnie can understan' it.  What's your name, sir?'
</p>

<p>
"'Eean.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'll pray for ye, Eean, and so will mother.'
</p>

<p>
"It was a month after this conversation ere I could
stroll about the beach, and paint rock and cloud
effects.  The girl was seldom with me.  She would be
away out at sea casting nets with her father, and in
her simplest attire, to my eyes, she always made the
prettiest picture.
</p>

<p>
"Boys, this story of mine is in some measure a
confession.  I have at all events confessed to you
already how idle and how vain I was, and now I am
going to give you another illustration of my vanity
I made up my mind then to make this girl my wife.
I positively thought I had only to go in and win.
</p>

<p>
"I was well now, and it was only for her sake I still
lingered in the village.  I had taken up my abode at
the village inn because, though they had nursed me
back to life, those kindly fisher people positively refused
to accept of anything in the shape of pecuniary reward.
All that I was permitted to do was to paint the old
couple sitting together Bible in hand on the stone dais
in front of their little cottage door.
</p>

<p>
"So one day I called on the mother, but was not
displeased to find the girl there too.
</p>

<p>
"I soon stated the object of this particular visit.
</p>

<p>
"'I <i>intended</i>,' I said, 'to make her daughter my wife.'
</p>

<p>
"A quick flush came over the girl's face.  She glanced
just once in my direction, then bent again over her
white seam.
</p>

<p>
"'You intend,' said the old lady, 'to make my
daughter your wife.  O, sir, do you think sae little of
us, that ye imagine ye hae only to command?  We are
only poor fisher-folks, sir, but we have the pride of
honesty in our hearts.  Na, na, na, sir, there is a great
gulf fixed 'twixt you and us.  Gang awa', sir, gang
awa', and marry some gentle dame, that ye can introduce
to your dear lady mother.  May every blessin' on
earth he yours, sir.  We're nae insensible to the
honour ye would do us.  Dinna think us ungrateful&mdash;'
here the good old soul broke down and cried&mdash;'but
gang and leave us to our poverty and our honest toil.'
</p>

<p>
"'So be it, madam, so be it,' I said.  'I have yourself
and daughter to thank for my life, but it was not to
show my gratitude I made the proposal, but because I
am wise enough to discover sterling worth and goodness
even beneath a humble garb.  Good-bye.  I'll never
think of marriage more.'
</p>

<p>
"I shook the mother's hand warmly.  I but touched
the girl's.  To have looked even once in her sweet
tearful face would have unmanned me, so I all but fled.
</p>

<p>
"I left the village long before daylight.  I went
home.  Then I told my mother all.
</p>

<p>
"My muse was now my only comfort, for months
went by before I thought again of painting.
</p>

<p>
"Then the same old idea recurred to me that had so
nearly cost me my life on the mountain side.
</p>

<p>
"The book, <i>The Easel and the Harp</i>.  <i>The Thistle and
the Rose!</i>
</p>

<p>
"I commenced work in earnest now.  But,
alas! misfortune befell me.  My soldier father died.  He
died in debt, and one short year afterwards I laid my
darling mother in the church-yard beside him.
</p>

<p>
"I was alone in the world now&mdash;alone and with
only a few thousands of pounds betwixt me and want,
should I fail with my brush.
</p>

<p>
"I was awakened at last to the reality of life, and
tried hard to do my best to face its storms.
</p>

<p>
"My great book!  I laid my plans before publisher
after publisher.  Some of these received me kindly,
praised the idea, but did not see their way.
</p>

<p>
"One told me that the people were not educated yet
up to such a work, and it was to the people he had to
look for success.
</p>

<p>
"I laid my plans before great artists.  Each and all
of these dissuaded me from any such undertaking.  I
called this envy.  O the vanity of young manhood!
</p>

<p>
"I visited printers and lithographers next, as well
as engravers.  Each and all of these assured me the
world was ripe for such a work, and by publishing it
myself I should not only secure fame, but all the
profits.
</p>

<p>
"I went home rejoicing, and at once commenced to
work out my scheme.  I soon after retired to a quiet
rural village, and here I lived like a recluse for a whole
year, working but dreaming as well.
</p>

<p>
"My work was finished.
</p>

<p>
"My book was published.  <i>The Easel and the Harp</i>.
<i>The Thistle and the Rose!</i>
</p>

<p>
"It did <i>not</i> go like wild-fire.  The critics hardly
noticed it, not even to revile.  I wished they had.
Hardly a copy was sold, and I was all but ruined.
</p>

<p>
"I saw my vanity when it was too late.  How
bitterly now I felt the truth of the scriptural text,
'Pride goes before a fall, and haughtiness before
destruction.'
</p>

<p>
"I had not been like the moth that seeks glory
by courting a too close acquaintanceship with the
candle, and falls groundwards with singed wings; but
like the moth that set out to fly to the evening
star, when, lo! clouds arose and rain fell, then down
came the all too ambitious flutterer, every gossamer
featherlet in its downy body draggled and wet, to lie in
the grass and suffer sorrow.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies;<br>
  All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.<br>
  Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,<br>
  Men would be angels, angels would be gods.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"I hardly cared now to meet my old associates, much
less my old masters.  They had warned me in my
overweening pride, I spurned their warning, and now I
was crushed and hopeless.
</p>

<p>
"I believe to this day that I took my punishment
like a man, I did not even pretend to laugh and treat
my discomfiture lightly; so many of my friends would
have stuck to me, and assisted me up again once more.
But I shook the dust of London from my feet, and
went away once more into the country to meditate and
think.  There still was hope for me.  I was young,
why should I mourn?
</p>

<p>
"The moth that tried to reach the star was able to
fly again next evening, though it never could be the
same moth as before.  I had aimed at a too high ideal.
I thought I had almost reached it.  I fell.  But I
should rise again.  Yes; but never the same man.
</p>

<p>
"I should leave this country, however and begin life
anew in some far distant clime, and&mdash;so I vowed&mdash;endeavour
to climb the ladder of fame one step at a
time, instead of foolishly trying to rush it as I had done.
</p>

<p>
"And now I did the only wise thing I had yet done
in my life.  I took the little remains of my fortune&mdash;it
consisted only of hundreds now&mdash;and placed it in a
bank, keeping but enough to last me with economy a
year.  Then I left my native land, taking ship for the
Antipodes as a steerage passenger.  I even changed my
name, so determined was I to forget all my past life.
</p>

<p>
"There was one portion of it, however, I never could
forget, and that was the short but happy time I had
spent during my convalescence in the little village, and
the humble fisher lassie's last tearful looks of adieu.
That would be the loadstone that should draw me back
to Britain if anything ever could.
</p>

<p>
"But I became strangely enamoured of a sea life
and of ships and sailor men.  We had a long, dreary
passage out around the Cape in a sailing vessel, and
before I had been out a fortnight I asked permission of
the captain, and obtained it too, to go before the mast.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I had found my vocation at last.  I
almost believed I had, for in a month's time there
was scarcely any part of a seaman's duty I could not
perform, and before we reached Australia I was dubbed
a sailor.
</p>

<p>
"I had been a favourite with my messmates, and
even with the few passengers aft, and I believe all were
sorry to part with me.
</p>

<p>
"But the gold fever was then at its height, and what
more natural than I should catch it?  Not all at once,
however.  I stayed around Sydney for a time.  I
managed to beat up several newspaper men and artists
like myself.  But this work was all too slow, the
remuneration too small, for me.
</p>

<p>
"One day I found myself standing alone in the
street in the drizzling rain, without hope, without a
home, and nothing belonging to me except the somewhat
tattered clothes I wore.  I was near a newspaper office,
and was about to enter to beg&mdash;not for money, boys,
I'd have died sooner&mdash;but for work, when I found
myself face to face with a man who was, like myself,
an artist.
</p>

<p>
"'Off to the diggings!' he cried merrily.  'Join me,
old fellow, join me.  We will return as rich as Croesus.'
</p>

<p>
"'I'd go,' I said, 'but I'm&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
"I turned out my empty pockets.
</p>

<p>
"'I'll wait for you a week,' he said, 'and you shall
work.  Come in here.'
</p>

<p>
"He pulled me inside the very office I had been
about to enter; and in a fortnight's time we were both
marching away to the diggings, with hopes as high as
the fleecy clouds and hearts as&mdash;well, as light as our
purses.
</p>

<p>
"Did we succeed?  At last we did, after ten years
of a life of back-breaking slavery.  We stuck together
all this time, and our adventures would have filled a
lordly volume.  We found time, too, to write to the
papers, and send many a sketch of life at the
diggings.
</p>

<p>
"We made a pile at last, and gladly agreed to leave
this rough-and-tumble life and settle in some town, or
come back&mdash;this was my idea&mdash;to Scotland.
</p>

<p>
"Fools that we were, we gave what was called a
'glorification' to our friends the night before we were
to start on horseback with our pile away through the
bush.
</p>

<p>
"I hate to dwell on this part of my story.  But
there came that evening to our camp two Irish
strangers.  They seemed green-hands, and I and my
friend took them in and treated them well We talked
too freely about our wealth of gold, and we lived to
repent it.
</p>

<p>
"We bade all the camp good-bye next day, and with
our convoy started for Melbourne.
</p>

<p>
"Day after day, day after day, through forest and
bush, living on damper and wretched tea, and sleeping
by night under the stars, but light-hearted and happy.
</p>

<p>
"'Hold!  Put up your hands!'
</p>

<p>
"It was a shout of command, given by two men on
horseback as we rode through a beautiful gully one day.
</p>

<p>
"We had no time to draw and defend ourselves, and
our servants were paralysed with fear.
</p>

<p>
"The robbers were the self-same Irish green-hands
we had entertained in camp.
</p>

<p>
"Of all our pile they left us barely fifty pounds a
piece, and this, they told us, they gave us out of
charity.
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
"Two months after this I was serving as a common
sailor on a merchant ship bound for San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
"During the long, hard years in the Australian bush
I had not quite forgotten my art, and I hoped to make
it pay in a new land.
</p>

<p>
"Once more I was partially successful.  Once again,
boys, I began to dream dreams of greatness, and once
again my dreams worked my ruin.
</p>

<p>
"My art was praised by some, my verses were said
by others to have about them the ring and rhythm of
the born bard.  I forgot or neglected art for poesy, and
soon found myself penniless and without work itself.
</p>

<p>
"Ambition, lads, is a grand thing; but it must be
guided by a steady hand at the tiller, or it is a ship
that will never sail into the haven of success.
</p>

<p>
"I need not tell you all, nor any of my wild adventures
for the next eight years of my life by sea or land.
You have heard the mythological tale of the man who
prayed that everything he touched might turn into
gold, and how the gods granted his prayer, and how
his very food became gold as he tried to lift it to his
lips, so that he died of starvation.  Nothing I touched
turned to gold, but, like Dead-sea fruit, every scheme
of mine turned to dust in my attempt to grasp it.
</p>

<p>
"At last, in a fight with lions in the forests of
Africa, I was seized and carried away by a man-eater.
The monster was wounded, and, though he lacerated
me fearfully, he laid down and died at my side.  My
companions soon followed and found me, and after a
weary time I recovered a tithe, but not more, of my
former life and spirit.
</p>

<p>
"The adventure had made almost an old man of me,
and in my weakness and debility I had but one wish,
one desire&mdash;to return to my native land and die!
</p>

<p>
"I did return.  Providence was good to me, and the
sea had in some measure restored me a portion of
my pristine strength.
</p>

<p>
"I visited my Highland home and my mother's
grave.  Then an irresistible longing stole over me to
visit this little wild glen.
</p>

<p>
"I stood one day on the very hill-top where well-nigh
twenty years ago I had dreamt of nought save glory.
</p>

<p>
"All seemed the same on this sweet summer's day,
the sea, the hills, the rocks, the wee whitewashed
houses standing among the greenery of the waving
birches, and the blue smoke trailing over the trees.
</p>

<p>
"Then I went quietly down the hill.  Alas! where
now was the bounding fire and fury of my youth?  I
almost shuddered when I saw the precipice over which
I had fallen, and the pine tree still denuded of
branches that had saved my life.
</p>

<p>
"In a few minutes more I stood at the door of the
village inn.  There were new people here now, but the
old folks could scarce have known me, so changed
had I become.
</p>

<p>
"While I munched my morsel of bread and cheese,
washed down with milk, a tall figure passed the window
leading a child.  I knew her step at once, though she
too was sadly changed.  But I wondered to notice that
her hair was sprinkled with gray.
</p>

<p>
"All my heart seemed to go forth to her.
</p>

<p>
"'That,' said the landlady, 'is the kindliest creature
in all the parish.'
</p>

<p>
"'Her name?' I almost gasped.
</p>

<p>
"'Miss Elspet Deane.'
</p>

<p>
"'Miss?  Ah, then she is not married?'
</p>

<p>
"'No; there is some sad story about her&mdash;about an
artist she ought to have married, but who went away
and was drowned at sea.'
</p>

<p>
"'And you say she is good and kind?'
</p>

<p>
"'Good and kind, sir!  What would the clachan do
without her?  We all call her auntie.  I don't know
why.  Some bairnies began it, I suppose.  Ah! don't
the bairnies love her, sir!  And she lives all by herself,
and that wee laddie in the house where her parents
died.  Never a child is ill in the village, sir, that she
doesn't attend.  She gathers the herbs and simples on
the moors, and mixes them with her own honest hands,
and little toddlers will take physic from her who
would spurn it from the doctor.'
</p>

<p>
"'Dear sir,' continued this somewhat garrulous
landlady, 'death itself doesn't seem so dreadful when
she is in the room.  And she has aye a word of comfort
for poor wives, when their boats are detained at sea or
blown far, far away by the raging storm.  On that
terrible Tuesday, sir, and all the dark drear night that
followed, when the wind blew louder and the sea was
wilder than anybody ever remembered it before&mdash;when
out of eleven boats and their brave crews but only
five regained the shore, Miss Elspet was everywhere,
directing, sir, and comforting, praying with the widows
and the fatherless bairns, and sometimes even scolding
the women for their want of trust in the Maker&mdash;like
a very angel in the midst of the great grief that
wailed around her.'
</p>

<p>
"'The boy, sir?  He had no mother, and his father
was drowned on that stormy night&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I stopped to hear no more,
</p>

<p>
"In ten minutes' time I was in the well-remembered
wee room in Elspet's house, and she stood before me.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that, hardy and strong as she was, she
would have faulted.
</p>

<p>
"'Eppie,' I said, 'it is <i>me</i>!'  Yes, boys, I forgot my
grammar just then.  'You could not marry me when I
was rich and young, now I am old&mdash;though not in
years&mdash;and I am poor and ill.  You nursed me once,
Eppie.  Will you nurse me again?'  Ah! lads, it has
been a new life to me since the village bells rang on
our wedding morn.  I have found peace and contentment
at last, and after the fever of life I can rest me
here.  Are we not happy, Eppie?"
</p>

<p>
He did not give Eppie time to reply.
</p>

<p>
"Yonder sits the drowned fisherman's son, Fred, who
saved your life to-day, Frank Fielding."
</p>

<p>
"And the wee thing who has gone to sleep on my
lap," said Frank Fielding, "she is?"
</p>

<p>
"A shipwrecked waif; a stray from the sea.  But
now, lads, to bed."
</p>

<p>
Then the birr-rr-rr of the wheel ceased, and Eppie,
rising, took wee Toddie from Frank to carry her off to
bed.
</p>

<p>
But Toddie was wide awake now, and all dimples,
smiles, and yellow hair.
</p>

<p>
She pointed a fat little forefinger at Frank as she
was being borne away on Eppie's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Be a dood boy, Flank," she cried, "and mind oo say
oo players."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
SITTING UP TO THINK&mdash;THE DIGNITY OF LABOUR.
</h3>

<p>
Frank Fielding wondered where he was
when he awoke next morning, and found the
sun shining in through the window of the
little cosy room in which he had slept so
soundly after his adventure, the night before.
</p>

<p>
Fred's room was in a back wing of the
cottage that looked right away out to sea.  But Fred
had not slept so well, and the reason was not far to
seek.  He had often before heard his Daddy Pop, as he
called the old fisherman, tell snatches of his life story,
but never had listened to its complete recital.  And
when he retired that night to his little chamber he was
as full of thought as any boy of his age can be.  The
feeling uppermost in the lad's innocent mind was one
of sorrow for Daddy Pop's sadly wasted life.  The old
man had made it so plain to his listeners what the
cause of his failure had been.  He had been a dreamer
instead of a student and a worker.  Would there, he
thought, be any chance for a humble lad like himself
doing well in the world if he worked and studied?
The question kept him awake half the night, and
even then he hadn't half answered it.  But long before
this he had made up his mind that he would work
and study, and he really felt thankful he had the
chance, for the parish church school he attended was
excellent&mdash;in other words, it was thoroughly Scottish&mdash;it
sent at least half a dozen lads every year straight
from it away to the University, and more than one of
these had become senior wranglers at Cambridge or
double first classes at Oxford.
</p>

<p>
But what, thought Fred to himself that night, was
the good of being a wrangler? whatever the somewhat
pugilistic word might mean.  He supposed, however, it
meant that the wranglership opened the way to one
through the thorny jungle of life, and softened many a
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
He thought, nevertheless, he shouldn't care much to
be a wrangler.  One wrangler, he remembered, had
come back to his own Highland parish to die.  That
was what wrangling had done for him.
</p>

<p>
Fred did not care a very great deal for either Latin
or Greek, both of which languages he was already well
versed in.  But then Daddy Pop had told him&mdash;and
didn't Daddy Pop know everything?&mdash;that learning and
study made one active-minded, clever, and bright; that,
in fact, it wasn't so much what anyone actually did
learn as the actual learning of it, that did the good,
and increased the size and fertility of the brain just
as&mdash;and these were Daddy's own words&mdash;the ploughing
and harrowing of a field fitted it to receive any sort of
seed that might be sown therein.  "But," Daddy Pop
had added, "it is as well to learn what will be useful
in after life, and the so-called dead languages would
be so."
</p>

<p>
Fred perhaps ought to have gone to sleep as soon as
he went to bed; but having once commenced to think
he could not.  He thought out all Daddy Pop's story,
first lying on one side, then he rolled over on the other,
and thought it all over again.  Then, as it was getting
late, he rolled over on his back and determined to sleep.
Pah! he might as well have tried to fly.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said to himself, "I don't see any good in
lying here tumbling all the bed.  It is hard work, and
nothing good to show for."
</p>

<p>
So up he jumped, and drew aside his little
window-blind.  The window was in shadow; but he could sea
that the moon was shining brightly over the sea, so he
quietly dressed himself, opened wide the window, and
sat down beside it.
</p>

<p>
Toddie's dachshund was out there under a bush, and
coughed a low enquiring sort of a bark at him.
</p>

<p>
"Down, Tippetty, down!" said Fred.
</p>

<p>
Tippetty did lie down, but not without a little growl
of displeasure.
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be in bed, you know," the little wise
fellow appeared to say; "and I'm responsible for the
safety of this establishment after nightfall."
</p>

<p>
Fred gave himself up to thought now, just as heartily
as in bed he had tried to avoid it.  Of course there
was a little castle-building mixed up with these
cogitations of his.  And I would not care much for a
boy who did not build a few castles in the air at times,
and inhabit them too; for what, after all, is
castle-building but a kind of budding ambition?
</p>

<p>
Now Fred Arundel's father had been drowned when
the boy was far too young to know the meaning of the
sacred word "parent," while his mother had been taken
away quite in his babyhood.  But he had come to love
and respect his foster-parents very much indeed.  They
were all in all to him.  Fred was a good-natured lad,
and there was nothing he would not have done to give
the kindly old couple an hour's happiness.
</p>

<p>
Well, but for them he might have been running
about in rags and wretchedness a "mitherless bairn,"
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When a' other bairnies are hushed to their hame,<br>
  By auntie, or cousin, or freckled grand-dame,<br>
  Who stands lost and lonely, wi' nobody carin'?<br>
  'Tis the poor doited laddie&mdash;the mitherless bairn,<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The mitherless bairn gangs to his lone bed,<br>
  Nane covers his cauld back, or haps his bare head;<br>
  His wee hackit heelies are hard as the iron,<br>
  And litheless the lair o' the mitherless bairn."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
But Fred could not have been called "a mitherless
bairn."  And indeed if you were to have asked the lad
confidentially he would have told you he was not a
"bairn" in any sense of the word, but almost a man.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy Pop is old," thought Fred, "but he may live
for twenty years and more yet, and so may Mammy too.
Twenty years, what a long time!  Why I shall be
getting old myself in that time.  Now although Daddy
had some money in the bank before he went away on
his long wanderings, and found when he came back
that it had grown into a heap more; and although he
had enough to build this cottage, and a fine fishing-boat
also, still I know he isn't rich.  His bed is not a
very soft one, he doesn't live so well as I would like
him to; he says he can't afford an easy chair, and that
his Sunday coat is good enough.  Well, if I had money,
Daddy would have such a lot of comforts, and so would
Mammy Mop.  Why shouldn't Mammy have a silk
dress as well as farmer Grigg's wife?  She shall have it.
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't Daddy have an easy chair and a
better pair of specs, and an easier seat in the cave
among the rocks in which he writes his beautiful
poetry?  My Daddy shall be comfortable when I am
older.  But what shall I be?  I can't be a fisher lad.
Oh, no!  I must travel and see the world, and&mdash;but, dear
me! common sailors don't get rich, and Sandie Davis
told me, after he came back from being all round and
round the world, that often and often he was not
allowed to put a foot on shore even in some of the
prettiest places on the face of the earth.  Sandie told
me this because he likes me.  Sandie wouldn't tell
everybody, I'm sure of that.  It wasn't for the half
crown I lent Sandie that he likes me.  Oh, no!
</p>

<p>
"But what does Sandie do?  He comes home wearing
his best blue clothes, and a dandy tie, and silver rings
and things, and to hear him talk anybody would think
he had been first officer of a ship.  He smokes and
takes beer&mdash;not that he pays for it, except by the
stories&mdash;yarns he calls them&mdash;that he tells those who
treat him.  No, poor Sandie never has a penny to
bless himself with after he has been two weeks at
home.  That isn't the kind of sailor I'm going to be, if
ever I'm a sailor at all.  Sandie's mother has a lot of
'curios,' as he calls them&mdash;some wonderful Japanese
boxes, bottles of <i>eau de Cologne</i>, a funny-looking
tea-caddy made out of a nut, an ostrich's egg, a savage's
spear, and an old bow and arrow; but nothing she can
eat or wear.  She can't even eat the ostrich's egg, and
funny she'd look going about with that dirty old bow
and arrow.
</p>

<p>
"He's not a bad fellow, though he boasts and brags,
and talks through his nose, and says words I never
heard before, and don't wish to hear again, for sailors
like Sandie would make me sick of the sea.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'll be something&mdash;something.  I'm going to
study and work to begin with, and then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Only the moonlight lying clear on the sea, only the
lisp of the waves on the shore, only the whisper of
wind in the trees, only&mdash;why, it can't surely be
daylight already!
</p>

<p>
But it is though, and has been for hours, though
Fred still sits there, his face and his arms, and his
bare head exposed to the morning breeze.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you naughty Fred!" cried Toddie, discovering
her foster-brother, and pulling his hair to wake him.
"Oo has never been to bed.  I declare oo'll bleak my
heart; and Flank and I has been all wound the beach
and at the atwalium (aquarium) too.  Flank's a dear,
dood boy.  Tome to bleakfast at once, I tell oo."
</p>

<p>
Fred looked up, smiling sleepily, then he gave himself
a shake, as a dog would, jumped right through the
window, and patted Toddie's head.
</p>

<p>
"I'll be back in ten minutes, Toddie, old woman,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Then straight for the rocks he ran, and divesting
himself of his clothes in a little recess, sprang in, had
a good swim, and returned home singing, and quite as
happy as the skylark that was lilting high above the
woods.
</p>

<p>
Frank came out of the cottage to meet him, and the
two lads shook hands heartily.
</p>

<p>
"You're none the worse for your ducking," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
"No, all the better.  Ha! ha!  I wonder what
mother will say?  But tell me, are you always so
late of coming down to breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
Fred laughed.
</p>

<p>
"It isn't coming down," he said, "because, you
know, we haven't any up.  Yours is a big fine house,
I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a fair size.  Two story, you know, and all
among woods and gardens.  Oh, I'm sure you'll like
it!"
</p>

<p>
It was time for Fred to laugh again.
</p>

<p>
"Very likely I shall see it," he said somewhat
ironically; "but come in till I sup my porridge."
</p>

<p>
"I've had mine long ago, and so has Toddie, and
we've had such a game of romps.  But of course you'll
come often to Benshee House.  I have a Shetland pony
and a little trap, and can come over to you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but, Frank Fielding," Fred said solemnly, as
he dipped his spoon in a basin of creamy milk, "don't
forget I'm only a poor working lad, and you are a
young gentleman."
</p>

<p>
The tears sprang to poor Frank's eyes in a moment
but he manfully kept even a single one from falling.
He stretched out his hand and grasped that of Fred,
even though he had the spoon in it.
</p>

<p>
"There," said Frank, "I've made you spill the milk.
But never mind.  Now, Fred, just listen.  Don't be a
fool.  I'm not a cad, mind.  My father is a Scotchman,
though my mother is English.  My father made his
money in stocks, and might lose it to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Avertit omen</i>," murmured Fred.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know Chinese, Fred; but I do know this,
you and I are going to be fast friends, and bother the
rank and riches.  My father makes me learn Burns's
poems.  My mother thinks they are not <i>bon ton</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Bong tong," said Fred.  "Well, I don't know
Japanese."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind.  Just listen to this.  I'm going to
recite.  Father makes me do it.  Now here is the scene.
You are a baronet and I am Bobbie Burns.  I have
been visiting you, you know, staying a few days at
your mansion, when a nobleman&mdash;a downright cad&mdash;comes
also to visit you, and you ask him if he would
object to the ploughman poet dining with him.
</p>

<p>
"'What!' cries this ignoble nobleman, 'a ploughman
singing fellow dining with you and me!  How very
absurd to be sure!'
</p>

<p>
"Then you, Sir Fred, are awfully put about, and you
come to me sheepishly, and explain matters, and I bite
my tongue and don't say anything.
</p>

<p>
"Well, after dinner his lordship says, 'Now, pon
honour, I'd like to hear your singing fellow just for
five minutes, don't-cher-know?'
</p>

<p>
"And so I&mdash;Robert Burns&mdash;am asked in.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I'm in a boiling rage at being treated
thus.  So I strut in and bow to you and his lordship,
that is Toddie yonder.
</p>

<p>
"'Singing fellow,' says the lord, 'give us a specimen
of your poetic powahs.'
</p>

<p>
"And this is the specimen I give:

"Oh!" cried little Toddie, clapping her pink hands,
"oo is a pletty boy when oo speaks like that."
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Frank, laughing, "I think like Burns,
Fred, and if you don't come and see me and be friendly
it will be all your own fault."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come," said Fred, laughing, "and if I happen
to be carrying a creel of lobsters, I suppose you won't
set your dogs at me?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, because father talks about the dignity of
labour, and that would be the dignity of labour.  And
you know&mdash;'a man's a man for a' that.'"
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!  Frank Fielding," cried the old fisherman,
entering the room, "How I love your sentiments, my
boy.  Why they are noble&mdash;noble.  Shake the old
bard's hand."
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Toddie, "evelybody must hold his tongue,
I'se goin' to 'cite a piece."
</p>

<p>
And this little waif and stray that the Atlantic
waves had tossed up on the beach as if she had been
seaweed, stepped boldly into the arena, that is, into
the middle of the sanded floor.
</p>

<p>
She was a beautiful child, this Toddie, with large
eyes, delicate features, and such a wealth of glossy
hair that one could not but wonder how it could have
grown on a head so young.
</p>

<p>
She held one wee arm aloft, and in slow and
measured tones, with many a brief but impressive
pause, spoke as follows:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There once was a leetle, leetle dirl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&mdash;lived&mdash;in a shoe,<br>

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Frank looked much amused, but quite puzzled; the
old bard patted his foster-daughter, and smiled not a
little proudly; while Fred roared with laughter because
Frank looked so enquiringly droll.
</p>

<p>
"Is there any meaning in all that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," cried Fred, "and it's all true; at least the
last of it.  Toddie and I, and Toddie's children, that is
her pets and things, do really live in a whale."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, shouldn't I like to see it!" said Frank.  "Hullo!"
he added, as the rattling of wheels ceased at the cottage
door, "here is mother in the pony chaise, and&mdash;why
look, there is Bunko himself driving my pony carriage
with the Shetland in it!  I wonder how the pony
allowed him."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, because if anybody but myself drives him he
nearly always lies down to roll."
</p>

<p>
Frank ran to meet his mother, who lovingly embraced
him.  She was a very handsome lady and Toddie
really stood in awe of her at first.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," Toddie said to Fred in a kind of stage whisper,
"Oh, Fred, I don't like her much, I weally must suck
my fumb."
</p>

<p>
And so she did.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
AT THE FISHERMAN'S CAVE&mdash;FRED'S AQUARIUM.
</h3>

<p>
"And where," said Mrs. Fielding, "are the dear
brave children who saved my darling's life?"
</p>

<p>
"Here is Fred, mamma, and yonder is
Toddie, hiding behind her daddy's legs."
</p>

<p>
"Toddie," said Fred, "take your thumb
out of your mouth."
</p>

<p>
"Come to me both of you.  Dear, dear, it was quite
an adventure I'm sure.  What dear children!  I'm
sure they ought both to have the Society's medal.
Very poor, aren't they?  I must do something for them."
</p>

<p>
These last words, though addressed quietly to Frank,
were loud enough for all to hear.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ma!" he said.
</p>

<p>
But the lady heeded not.
</p>

<p>
"And you are the fisherman poet, are you not, sir?"
she said, turning to the bard.
</p>

<p>
The old man was standing as erect as a statue, his
bonnet in his hand, his hair streaming over his neck,
and his face somewhat set and stern.  He really looked
noble.  Mrs. Fielding must have felt he did, or she
would never have added that little word "sir" in
addressing him.
</p>

<p>
"I've heard of you so often, in really good society
too.  You write those beautiful verses in a cave, do you
not?  Why they are in every good magazine.  Do you
know I <i>should</i> like to see your cave.  So romantic!
Might I, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;A&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
"Arundel.  My cave is a very humble place, Mrs. Fielding;
but if you will come with me you shall see
it.  The road is rough though."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I'm very strong!"
</p>

<p>
Away along by the top of the cliffs he led her for
quite a quarter of a mile.  Here some bushes grew,
and among them was a half-hidden staircase leading
downwards into the very bosom of the rocks.  The
steps had been cut a hundred years ago perhaps by
smugglers.  No one ever yet found out the mystery of
Talbot's cave.
</p>

<p>
The lady condescended to take the bard's hand, and
he led her down.  It was almost dark at the bottom,
but once in the strange cave it was light enough.  Here
were two windows, or rather ports, and one of these
the bard threw open.  Right down beneath was the deep
sea, with clear water over shining yellow sand, so clear
you could see the beautiful medus√¶ or jelly fish floating
about like splendidly-jewelled parasols.  Between the
ports was the poet's rough deal table.  Here was a
bench of deal, and a tall-backed deal chair.  The floor
was laid with wood, and a great ship-lamp swung
from the roof.
</p>

<p>
The irregular walls were the rough rocks, but much
to Mrs. Fielding's amazement, these walls were adorned
with water-colour and oil-colour paintings, that to her
seemed priceless.
</p>

<p>
I had almost forgotten to say that there was a
fireplace in this cave, and evidence enough too that
Eean often had tea here.
</p>

<p>
But it was the pictures that most attracted the
lady's notice.
</p>

<p>
"These," she said, "are not mere copies?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam," said the bard, smiling somewhat sadly,
"every one of them, but copies from Nature.  Mostly
things I daubed when travelling abroad, they serve just
to remind me of scenes I have passed through during
a somewhat chequered career.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said Mrs. Fielding with innocent
candour, "which to admire the most, yourself or your
surroundings."
</p>

<p>
"Round every one of these picture things, madam, I
have to weave a tale for my foster-children, who come
here in the summer and even winter evenings.
</p>

<p>
"How enchanting.  Might my dear boy come
sometimes too?"
</p>

<p>
Eean stretched out his hand as if by sudden impulse,
and Mrs. Fielding clasped it cordially.
</p>

<p>
"Now you do delight me, madam.  I love children
and your boy is a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"I'm so pleased."
</p>

<p>
Then turning to the windows.
</p>

<p>
"You will observe," he said, "that the glass in these
ports is of very great thickness.  Green seas have often
dashed over them, yet we have never been flooded.
Only on stormy nights I lower great wooden ports."
</p>

<p>
He untied a chain as he spoke, and down with a
thud came a shutter of wood and iron.
</p>

<p>
"Safe you see against the mightiest gale that ever
blew."
</p>

<p>
"How interesting.  The sea too looks charming to-day
from your windows.  Was it out yonder my poor
darling was nearly drowned?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, madam."
</p>

<p>
There was a moment's surcease of talking, during
which nothing could be heard but the gentle
lap-lapping of the waves on the black rocks beneath.
</p>

<p>
"Are you fond of animal life, madam?
</p>

<p>
"Will you be startled if I introduce to you one or
two of my pets?"
</p>

<p>
"But they won't hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"No, they are good-mannered crabs."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke the bard took from his pocket a piece of
string to which was attached a morsel of fish.  This he
lowered into the sea through the open port, then slowly
drew it up again.
</p>

<p>
A moment afterwards there came crawling up two
immense crabs, and they positively appeared to enter
arm in arm, side by side certainly.  They paused for a
moment on the outside rocky ledge, and gazed at the
lady with their stalky eyes.
</p>

<p>
Seeming perfectly satisfied, they then advanced, and
Mrs. Fielding noticed that each had a red cross painted
across his dark shell.
</p>

<p>
The bard quietly spread before them their dinner,
and they ate it greedily, rolling their eyes about as
they did so with an appearance of great satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I make them dance?" said the poet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do, sir!"
</p>

<p>
The poet held a morsel of white meat of some kind
above them, and in a moment they were standing on
one end, hand in hand, or rather claw in claw, dancing
round and round and all about in the most comical
manner.
</p>

<p>
The lady laughed till the cave roof rang again.
</p>

<p>
"Of all things I have ever seen," she said, "that is
the most ridiculous."
</p>

<p>
Then one more morsel was given to each, a red
handkerchief was waved, and away the strange
performers shuffled, and slowly disappeared over the
ledge.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mrs. Fielding, what do you think of my red
cross knights?"
</p>

<p>
"Delightful! oh, delightful!  But pray, Mr. Arundel,
what are the red crosses for?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! so that they shall be known by fishermen.
They have often been captured in the lobster creels,
but no one would think of killing them."
</p>

<p>
"I have to thank you for such a pleasant hour," said
Mrs. Fielding, as they once more emerged upon the
cliff top.  "Oh, look!  Yonder comes my boy with
your dear mite on the Shetland pony."
</p>

<p>
Toddie waved her hand to Daddy Pop.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy!  Daddy!" she shouted as soon as near
enough to be heard, "I'se a weal lady now.  All I
wants is a widing-habit."
</p>

<p>
"My dear," said Mrs. Fielding, "a riding-habit would
hide the beauty of those shapely legs and feet."
</p>

<p>
Toddie looked at her, and at once commenced to
suck her thumb.
</p>

<p>
"Why do you suck your thumb, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I always suck my fumb when I'se finking!"
</p>

<p>
"And what are you thinking about, child?  What
makes you look at me so?"
</p>

<p>
"Is oo Flank's mammy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, pet."
</p>

<p>
"Oh-h!  Well, I likes Flank mostest.  Flank," she
added, with the air of a young princess, "we will wide
back adain, please."
</p>

<p>
And away they went at a mad trot, Frank shouting
and Toddie screaming.
</p>

<p>
"Mamma," said Frank when they met at the cottage,
"this is a school holiday with Fred.  Please may I
stay till evening?"
</p>

<p>
"Did ever I deny you anything, child?  But be
sure you're home in time.  Good-bye, Mr. Arundel.
Good-bye, dear children.  Drive on, John."
</p>

<p>
"Dood-bye," shouted Toddie, so gleefully that it must
have been evident even to Mrs. Fielding herself that
Toddie was glad to be rid of her.
</p>

<p>
"Now," cried the little madcap, "I feels full of joy
up to my mouf.  Tippetty and I is off for a wun on
the beach.  When Tippetty and I has our wun we'll
come back for you boys, and to-night we'll have tea in
the whale.  Tippetty!  Tippetty! oh, here tomes Tip!"
</p>

<p>
And off bounded Toddy and Tip, and no one seeing
the two scampering across the level sands would have
cared to say which was the wilder or which the defter.
</p>

<p>
Toddie's little arms and legs were bare, she had
pulled off her red fisherman's cap to wave it above her
head, and as she dashed on to meet the roaring sea her
hair floated straight behind her in the breeze.  And
Tippetty, the dachshund, barking with all his might,
came just a little in advance.
</p>

<p>
This spoke volumes for the strength of Tip's lungs.
Though lovely and hound-like in head, like all
dachshunds, he was bandy in legs, very low to the ground,
and of tremendous length.  So long and low indeed
was he, that when at the gallop his black body wriggled
like an eel.  So long was he that he could not jump
on a chair.  He could put his two paws and head up,
but if asked to spring, he looked about him wisely
at his tail end, as much as to say,
</p>

<p>
"I would jump up willingly with my front part, don't
you know? but then the other end of the procession
wouldn't come along."
</p>

<p>
Tippetty was one of the wisest and kindest-hearted
wee dogs that ever lapped milk.
</p>

<p>
He was the pet of the village, and no wonder, for
Tippetty dug bait for everybody.
</p>

<p>
"Is Tip at home?" a fisherman would say to Eppie
as he passed seawards.
</p>

<p>
"Tip, Tip," Eppie would cry, "you're wanted."  And
off he would go.  He knew the worms' holes in the
sand, and none could go too deep for Tip.  With his
little mole's feet and his wee bandy legs he would
throw the sand up behind him as if he were a living
mitrailleuse, and soon expose the coveted bait.
</p>

<p>
The first visit of the children to-day was to the
aquarium, and Frank listened with delight to the
terrible story of Tom, the naughty dolly-fish.
</p>

<p>
"But what a good thing," said Frank seriously, "that
you were there putting back the dolly-fish.  Else I
should have been drowned."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Toddie, nodding her demure morsel of a
head, "that was Plovidence, Flank.  Oh, yes I 'ssure
oo, Flank, it was Plovidence, 'cause Daddy Pop told me.
Now then."
</p>

<p>
After they had seen all the queer creatures in the
aquarium, and every creature's life history had been
told to Frank by Toddie, they went off to the woods.
"Dood-bye, dear, dear blennies," said Toddie, stroking
these marvellous wee fishes with a morsel of seaweed,
"be dood tsilden and oo mammy won't be long away."
</p>

<p>
Three of these were lying on the centre island of
the aquarium, like so many miniature walruses, and so
tame were they that they never moved when Toddie
stroked them.
</p>

<p>
This children's aquarium had been got up by Daddy
Pop, and he explained the nature of every new pot
that was put into it.  But he had never seen the
dogfish Tom.
</p>

<p>
Daddy Pop believed, and rightly too, that letting
children have a hobby keeps them out of many a
danger, and when that hobby was the keeping of living
pets in a condition of nature, it became in itself an
education, and brought the bairnies into direct
communication with the Creator, who loves all things He
has made.
</p>

<p>
What fun they had in the woods, but they went to
show Frank the terrible cliff over which Daddy Pop
had fallen when a young man.
</p>

<p>
The tree beneath was marked by a cross deeply cut
in the bark.
</p>

<p>
By the time they got back, Daddy was ready to
accompany them all to have tea in Toddie's whale.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
TAKING TEA INSIDE A WHALE&mdash;THE STRANGE STORY OF<br>
THE STRANDED LEVIATHAN.
</h3>

<p>
There were two persons who on this
particular afternoon considered themselves of
the very greatest importance.  One was
Bunko, the other Tippetty.  And the most
perfect understanding existed betwixt the
two.  Next to his little mistress, I feel
certain that Tip loved Bunko above all people, and
Bunko loved Tip, and admired him too.  Like many
peasants of his class, Bunko was fond of adorning his
conversation with Biblical phraseology, always,
however, with the greatest reverence and veneration.
Half-daft Bunko might have been, but the Scriptures
were indeed to him the Book of books, and the
beautiful and simple stories of the New Testament
were not beyond his childlike comprehension.
</p>

<p>
Therefore Bunko was really paying Tip a compliment
when he told that doggie he was more "subtle than
any other beast of the field," and like the serpent in
the book of Genesis.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, although Bunko made a companion of
"Tippie," as he called him, whenever he could get him
to make a companion of, he would not have permitted
anyone to say the dog had reason.
</p>

<p>
"I have na muckle reason mysel'," he told the old
fisherman one day, "but poor Tippie's only a breet"
[brute].
</p>

<p>
Then he scratched his head as he looked at his
four-footed friend.  "Ma! conscience though," he added,
"just look at they bewitchin' brown een [eyes] o' his.
What a lot o' wisdom the Good Lord <i>has lent him</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The fisherman thought this was certainly a new
light in which to view the controversy of Reason versus
Instinct.
</p>

<p>
Well, both the friends went to the igloo, as
Fred called the whale-house, early that afternoon, for
Bunko had caught Tippitty and carried him off in
triumph.  It was no easy matter either, to carry Tip;
for if Tip chose to wriggle you couldn't hold him in
one arm as you might a terrier, you required both,
and even then if the doggie made up his mind to
wallop but once, he was out of your grasp and off
like an eel.
</p>

<p>
"You're no goin' to the woods the day, I can tell
you, Tippie," Bunko had told him.  "We have gentry
folks comin' to tea, so you maun come and help me."
</p>

<p>
Bunko was dressed in his best, in his Sunday clothes
in fact, and a fearful and wonderful rig it was&mdash;a
Scotch bonnet as broad as a griddle with an immense
red top on it, a soldier's scarlet coat, and a pair of
tartan trowsers rather frayed at the bottom.
</p>

<p>
If you had told Bunko that the bonnet was too big
for him he would probably have replied: "If ye dinna
like it, ye can look the ither road.  Anything sets
[becomes] a weel-faured face, if it were only the
dish-clout."
</p>

<p>
In that great rugged wall of rocks that went
stretching away out into the western sea there was just
one break, and this occurred a little beyond the poet's
cave.  A kind of glen or small ravine it formed.  At
low-water you could approach it from the sea between two
tall frowning rocks, but if the tide were up you must
descend into it by a perilous little pathway leading
from the cliff above.  Only once, in the memory of
the villagers then living, had this glen been invaded by a
high-tide.  This had occurred some years before the date
of the commencement of our story, and, strange to say,
when the sea receded it left behind it a stranded whale.
</p>

<p>
This whale was a Godsend to the poor fisher folks.
One way or another, what with its whalebone, its oil,
and its great jaws, it had been sold piecemeal.  But
there still remained leaning against the cliff the huge
ribs of the leviathan, and here the children used to
play till one day it occurred to Bunko to make these
ribs the framework of a good house.
</p>

<p>
Eean, the bard, took up the idea at once, and what
with the help of an idle hand or two, always easily to
be had in a village, the ribs were roofed and covered
in all round, and when a floor and door had been put
in, not to mention a fire-place and a little window,
why surely never on earth was there a better or more
romantic children's play-house.
</p>

<p>
The bottom of the glen or gap in this wall of rocks
was grass, so Bunko's "mother-wit" came in handy
once again.
</p>

<p>
"What for no' have a bit garden round the house?"
Bunko had said.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said Eean; "but the soil isn't deep."
</p>

<p>
"Bide a wee, sir."
</p>

<p>
And, spade in hand, up he clambered to the cliff top.
It was well for the old fisherman that he had divined
Bunko's intentions and stood clear from under, for
presently the earth began to descend in avalanches.
Bunko in his excitement had evidently quite forgotten
that anyone stood beneath.  In less than a quarter of
an hour a heap of mould big enough for the purpose
lay alongside the igloo.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Eean had wandered round the corner,
deeply absorbed in the beauties of Ossian.  When he
returned, much to his astonishment he found that poor
Bunko had descended, and was digging into that heap
of earth with his coat off as if his future life depended
on it.  Eean walked quietly up behind him, for Bunko
was talking aloud, a word or two to each spadeful that
he threw aside.
</p>

<p>
It is said listeners never hear any good of themselves.
This case, however was an exception.
</p>

<p>
"O, poor Eean&mdash;O, poor dear old man&mdash;the best&mdash;and
the wisest&mdash;and the bonniest&mdash;auld man&mdash;'tween
here and Perth&mdash;and I've&mdash;buried him alive."
</p>

<p>
Eean had to laugh aloud now, and the look of
astonishment blended with joy on the half-witted
lad's face, as he looked about, was comical in the
extreme.
</p>

<p>
Down went the spade, and Bunko seized Eean's hand
and burst into tears.  Poor fellow, never a word could
he think of to utter at that moment except his grace
after meals:
</p>

<p>
"For these and a' Thy other mercies, Good Father,
make us truly thankfu'."
</p>

<p>
Having so far relieved his feelings, he picked up his
broad bonnet and threw it in the air, and as soon as it
descended he leapt nimbly on top of it, and cracking
his thumbs danced the tenth step of the Lonach
Hielan' fling without ever getting off.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye feel better now?" said Eean, much amused.
</p>

<p>
"That I do; but, O, sir, if I'd killed ye, I'd&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, Bunko?"
</p>

<p>
"Flung my body o'er the cliff for the partans [crabs]
to pick."
</p>

<p>
But the garden was laid out with a rustic railing
round it, and all the summer through lovely flowers
always bloomed therein, with roses and honeysuckle,
and wild convolvulus trailing over the fence.
</p>

<p>
On this autumn afternoon, the bright crimson Scotch
trop√¶olum, that refuses to grow out well of its native
land, encircled the igloo doorway with its masses of
flame-like flowers.
</p>

<p>
"Tippie, Tippie, here's the gentry.  Run and meet
them, Tip."
</p>

<p>
Yes, there they come&mdash;Fred and Frank and Toddie,
and the sturdy old weird-looking bard himself.
</p>

<p>
Bunko stood by the garden gate, pole in hand, as
the party approached.  "Shoulder arms," he shouted.
"Present arms."
</p>

<p>
And in due military style he stood there at the
present till they all filed past.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy taking tea in a whale!" cried Frank
delightedly.  "And such a tea!  Crisp oat-cakes,
scones, butter, and honey.  Dear me, how mother
would enjoy this!"
</p>

<p>
Eean took off his bonnet, and holding it before his
face asked a humble blessing, and then the meal
proceeded right merrily, Bunko waiting as sedately as a
butler, and Tippetty sitting on a stool with a bib on
him&mdash;Toddie's doings&mdash;as solemn as a judge.
</p>

<p>
Conversation never slackened all the time.
</p>

<p>
"What made you call it an igloo?" said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know," Fred replied, "I wasn't sure what
to call it at first.  A wigwam puts you in mind of
Red Indians, and there's no wild Indians here except
Toddie there.  A toldo is the tent that the Patagonian
tribes dwell in."
</p>

<p>
"Big men the Patadonians," Toddie told Frank
confidentially, "all diants, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Todd.  Well, I didn't like kraal because ito
puts you in mind of Hottentots, and Daddy Pop there
said an igloo was the house the Eskimos lived in, and
as this whale must have come from there I thought
I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see now!" Frank interrupted.  "Good idea too."
</p>

<p>
Toddie was looking very much absorbed.  At last
she turned to Eean.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy," she said, "oo don't think, does oo, that the
whale will ever tome alive adain?"
</p>

<p>
Then her bright eyes sparkled with merriment as
she clapped her wee pink hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what fun," she cried, "if the whale would
tome alive adain dust now, and do [go] away to sea
wi' us all sittin' here!"
</p>

<p>
Frank laughed and Fred too.  The idea was even
too much for Bunko's gravity, so he gave vent to a
loud guffaw; and Tip took the opportunity of barking
for another piece of buttered scone, and got it too.
</p>

<p>
Then, tea being over, they all sat round the fire, and
the bard took out his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"I'se dust wonderin'," said Toddie, looking wisely
at the blazing peats, "wherever this poor whale tame
from.  Plaps," she added sadly, "he had no mammy
Mop to look after him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" said Daddy, "he had a mother, Toddie."
</p>

<p>
"Tell us; oh, tell us," cried Frank, "another story!"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, master Frank; I'll only just talk a bit."
</p>

<p>
"You've been to Greenland, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Frank!  I've been blown about all over
the world, and got stranded on the beach here at last,
just like the whale in which we're now sitting so cosily."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Eean continued, "with all due respect for
Toddie's wisdom, I must differ from her; the probability
is, that this whale had a mother.
</p>

<p>
"You know, children, that whales are not fish, but
great beasts.  They couldn't live long beneath the
water without being drowned; half an hour at most.
When they are chased by boats and harpooned they go
through the water at a terrible speed, so quickly indeed
that the sea rises up from each of the boats' bows like
two sheets of green glass.  But the whale soon gets so
breathless that he can't go under water at all.
</p>

<p>
"The male or he-whale is called a bull, the she one a
cow, and the young one a calf, and it takes milk from
its mother just as any other calf does from its mother.
</p>

<p>
"Now the bulls are very kind to the cows.  They are
good-natured, kind husbands.  So we may suppose
that after this whale that we are now sitting in was
born, and was strong enough to swim funnily round
and round his big mammy, and knew enough to creep
under her flipper if he saw a ship coming, the bull said
to the cow&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"O Daddie," cried Toddie, "whales tan't talk."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Toddie, they talk with their eyes, and their
tails."
</p>

<p>
"Of tourse, of tourse," said Toddie, "dust like
Tippetty does.  Do [go] on, Daddy Pop."
</p>

<p>
"Says the bull to his wife&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'What would you think of a little run to the south,
my dear?  You've been looking rather pale about the
nose of late, and it would do you good, and little
Johnnie too.'
</p>

<p>
"'Little Johnnie was the calf, you know.'
</p>

<p>
"'But I don't really care to leave you,' says the cow.
</p>

<p>
"'O, nonsense, dear, go by all means.  Mind you,
Johnnie isn't a strong child, I don't believe he weighs
more than ten tons now, and he hasn't cut his
whale-bone teeth quite yet.'
</p>

<p>
"'Well, my dear,' says the cow, 'I'll just go to
please you.'
</p>

<p>
"So straight away down south comes the cow and
her calf.  It was a long, long journey for them.
Sometimes Johnnie, her big baby, would fall sound
asleep, and then his mother would spread one great
loving flipper over him, and paddle along with the
other so quietlike as if afraid of waking her darling.
</p>

<p>
"Then by-and-bye Johnnie would awake, and, like
any other calf, begin sucking at once, and nudging his
mother all the time with his bottle of a nose, raising
her a little above the clear blue waves at every
nudge.  Yes, boys, I've often seen what I'm trying
to describe to you.
</p>

<p>
"South and south went the mother and her calf, and
aye and aye the weather and the water grew warmer.
What gladsome times the two had together in these
sunlit seas! but Johnnie always kept close beside his
mother when sharks appeared, because the sharks
would have killed and eaten Johnnie.  But one stroke
of the whale cow's tail would kill five of the biggest
sharks that ever swam, and the sharks knew that and
kept well away.
</p>

<p>
"When the holiday was over, back the two went to
their own cold home in the north.  The cow swam
homewards as straight as an arrow.  She had no
compass to steer by, and the stars, if she went by
those, were often obscured; but the wonderful instinct
implanted in her by God, who makes and rules all
creatures and things, never deserted her, but guided
her on and on and on, till the tall icebergs once more
loomed out of the dark sea, with stars and aurora
shining and dancing above.
</p>

<p>
"Of course the husband was glad to see her.
</p>

<p>
"'How well you look, dear!' he said, as they rubbed
noses.
</p>

<p>
"'Yes,' she answered; 'and hasn't Johnnie grown
wonderfully!'
</p>

<p>
"'I hardly knew him, indeed,' said the bull.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now, when Johnnie was about a year old, a
whales' ball took place in Baffin's Bay.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Frank.  Mind, this is not a fairy tale.  I'm
speaking from the great book of Nature.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it isn't a real ball, you know, Toddie, only
Greenland sailors call it so because the young whales
all meet and dance about, and leap and jump, and
whack the water with their awful tails, till the whole
sea around is like a whirlpool, and covered with froth
and foam.  It is an interesting and a terrible sight.
Ships may view it from afar off, but they know better
than to go too close with boats, else these boats would
be smashed into match-wood in less than a minute.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I suppose Johnnie danced too much at this
ball, or ate too many gallons of the little shrimp things
that whales feed on.  Anyhow, next day he didn't feel
at all well.
</p>

<p>
"'I tell you what it is, Johnnie,' said Johnnie's
mother, 'you must take a run south, it will quite
brace you up again.'
</p>

<p>
"'What, all by myself?' cried Johnnie, wagging his
tail.  'Oh, that will be fun!'
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie's mother was very sorry to part with him,
but she thought it would be all for the best.  Ah! little
did she think she would never see her boy any more.
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie started off in great glee at first; but when
he was fairly clear of the ice, and the last white berg
had disappeared behind the horizon; when as he rose on
the great tumbling billows he could see nothing around
him but an illimitable expanse of ocean, without a
vestige of life in or over it, then he began to feel very
lonely indeed, and half repented having come away at
all.  There was Providence, however, to guide and to
guard him too, so he went steadily on and on, south,
south, south, by night and by day.  It was dreariest at
night, when the stars were all shimmering above, and not
a sound to be heard save now and then a sullen boom or
plash, that told Johnnie plainly enough there were his
enemies the sharks plunging about in the darkling sea
not far off.  Sometimes he slept and dreamt ugly dreams,
and awoke with a start, to find terrible-looking ocean
monsters with awful eyes staring up at him from the
dark depths.  He could see them because they were
all covered over with a silvery, ghost-like light called
phosphorescence, which is very common up in these
wild northern latitudes.  By day sharks often met
him&mdash;the huge hammer-headed sort&mdash;and pretended to be
friendly, and tried to lure him away into shallow water,
where they could easily have devoured him.
</p>

<p>
"But Johnnie thanked them, and said, 'No.'  He
knew his way, and would stick to it.
</p>

<p>
"Johnnie had many other enemies to encounter, such
as the sea unicorn, with its long spiral ivory horn&mdash;a
bold beast that will scarcely go out of its way even
for a ship.  He tried to stab Johnnie to the heart, and
if he had done so the sharks would have come to the
banquet, and eaten the pair of them.  But Johnnie
avoided the deadly thrust, and with one blow of his
tail pitched the unicorn nearly up to the moon.  At
least so the beast himself told the other unicorns he
met soon after.
</p>

<p>
"But Johnnie escaped all his enemies, and arrived at
last within sight of the Far√∂e Islands, where the water
was delightfully mild and the sun very bright.
</p>

<p>
"Now, had Johnnie done what his mother told him,
and not gone a mile further, all would have been well.
But these sunny summer seas were so blue and pleasant
that Johnnie went on and on.  His life passed like a
happy dream, the Shetland Islands hove in sight, bold
black rocky isles crowned with green fields, with
millions of sea birds all around them, then the
lonesome Orkney, and then Scotland itself.  There were
strange birds in the air that cried to Johnnie, 'Go
away, go away, away, away, away!' but Johnnie would
not be warned and wouldn't obey his mother, and
so&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Eean was not allowed to complete his story.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Toddie gleefully, "I know what is
toming, Daddy Pop."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then," said Frank, "can you complete the
story?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, you know," said Toddie, "if I tan
'plete the stoly, but I tan feenis' it.  The Dood God
rosed a dleat stolm, and poor Johnnie was dliven on
shore, and touldn't get back again to see his mammy."
</p>

<p>
"That's it, Toddie," said Eean.
</p>

<p>
And with that up jumped Frank.
</p>

<p>
"It is getting near gloaming," he said.  "I'm sorry I
must go; but, Toddie, I must do as my mother told me."
</p>

<p>
"Of tourse oo must, or plaps oo be deaded too, like
the poor Johnnie whale."
</p>

<p>
Half an hour afterwards Frank Fielding had said
adieu to his kindly though humble fisher friends, and
was rattling along through the moonlit woods towards
his home at Benshee.

"FIVE YEARS AGO THIS VERY NIGHT."
</h3>

<p>
The bay of Methlin was a very beautiful one,
wildly so in fact, although that black beetling
wall of rocks that went darkly stretching
seaward had at times a weird and uncanny
look about it, especially when half buried in
mist, with the mournful boom of the seas under it, and
far away, coming landwards from the grey gloom, the
plaintive but eerie cry of sea-birds.
</p>

<p>
In summer days, when the sun shone clearly over
the water, it was cheerful indeed to stroll along that
cliff top.  Whichever way one looked there was something
to cheer the sight&mdash;the far-off ships on the ocean
horizon, or a little island here and there that appeared
to float in the drowsy haze; the deep, deep green waves
below the rocks, rising and swelling as they rushed
inland, as if measuring their height against the
slippery blackness, the glorious hills themselves,
changing ever in beauty of shade as cloud-shadows raced
across their majestic brows; and the wee white-housed
village itself asleep in a wildery of trees.
</p>

<p>
Even when storms lashed over the rocks and rose in
snowy fountains to the green turf above, when the
hills were half-hidden in mixing masses of inky clouds,
and the sea's horizon lowered close in shore, there was
a beauty about both seascape and landscape that
probably only such a mind as that of Eean's could fully
appreciate.  His had a melancholy tinge imparted to
it from the bitter memories of a life that had been
nearly all disappointment.  His too was the soul of
the bard of Ossian or Homeric type, only deeply
imbued with religion.  No dark mythology was called
upon to account for the fierce war of storms that often
raged o'er sky and sea and land on this wild coast.
No; there was method even in the madness of the
tempest, there was golden light and beauty behind the
blackness; no thunder could roll, no lightning's flash
could rend the mountain rocks, no waves could swell
and break without the will of his Father&mdash;and his
Father was mercy and goodness personified&mdash;despite
the fact that He
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "&mdash;&mdash;moves in a mysterious way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wonders to perform,<br>
  And plants His footsteps on the sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rides upon the storm."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Far away then, on that wild cliff top, the tall figure
of the bard, with his broad bonnet and his wind-tossed
plaid, might have been seen at gloaming-tide of the
stormiest days.  His face at such times had a sterner,
more thoughtful aspect; his usually mild blue eyes
seemed to retreat beneath his lowering eye-brows; yet
ever and anon that face would soften, and a smile
irradiate its every feature, as some happy thought
crossed his mind.  Such flashes were like the blinks
of sunshine that sometimes fall from rifts of blue in
winter storms.
</p>

<p>
Or, tired of his walk, he would seek the entrance of
his cave, disappearing suddenly as if it were off the
face of the earth&mdash;as he really did, but a stranger
noticing that tall figure one moment by the cliff's side,
and missing it the very next, would have made sure
the old man had been blown over the rocks.
</p>

<p>
It was one evening, about a fortnight after Frank
Fielding had gone home to Benshee, that Eean had
retired from the green cliff above to his cave below.
Though quite light above, the cave was every now and
then plunged in total darkness by the dashing waves.
</p>

<p>
The bard stirred up his fire till the red light gleamed
fitfully on the rugged grey walls, then he sat down
in his chair leaning his chin on his hand to think.
</p>

<p>
He had a habit of talking aloud, a habit that is very
easily acquired by those who delight in being much by
themselves in very lonely places.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he was saying, "just this very night five
years ago that my wee pet came on shore."
</p>

<p>
Pit&mdash;pit&mdash;pit&mdash;pit.  It was the sound of softly-padded
feet coming trotting towards him, and next
minute Tippetty with immense effort had sprang on
his knees.
</p>

<p>
"Why Tip," said Eean, "what are you doing here? and
gasping too, with a quarter of a yard at least of
a pink ribbon of a tongue hanging out over your
snow-white teeth?"
</p>

<p>
Tip looked up with those speaking brown eyes of
his.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Daddy Pop," he seemed to say, "it blows so
high on the cliff top, and I've been running hard."
</p>

<p>
"Where is your mistress, you scamp?  You didn't
come all by yourself."
</p>

<p>
Tip's ears went away back on his neck in quite an
apologetic sort of way, and he glanced uneasily towards
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Dad&mdash;<i>dee</i>!"  It was Toddie's voice on the stone
stair staircase.
</p>

<p>
Tip sprang down to meet her, and next moment she
came in with a rush, her hair all a-toozle, her bare,
naked feet and baton legs as red as red could be, for
never would Toddie wear shoe or stocking except on
high days and holidays.
</p>

<p>
Next moment she was seated on one of Eean's knees,
and Tip on the other.
</p>

<p>
Toddie put one arm round Eean's neck, and entwined
her fingers in his hair, then looking up&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Isn't oo dlad I'se tomed?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Very glad you've got here safe, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Well, tiss me.  Now, this is nice.  Nice file bulning
there, and all.  Plaps I'll make oo sing to me bye'm-bye."
</p>

<p>
Toddie was a very despotic little queen in her own
wee way.  Queen she was of that old man's heart, and
she seemed to know it.
</p>

<p>
He was looking at her very fondly just then with a
curious kind of smile on his face.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you rather I'd tell you a story, Toddie?"
</p>

<p>
Toddie put her thumb in her mouth and gazed into
the fire.
</p>

<p>
"I fink," she said, "Plank likes stolies best."
</p>

<p>
"My own little Treasure-trove," said the bard.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy, don't oo make up such silly words."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>are</i> my Treasure-trove.  Do you know where
you came from, darling?"
</p>

<p>
"The Dood God sent me, of tourse."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, pet, the Good God sent you to cheer this old
man's heart, and brighten his life.  But do you know
you came from the sea?  That, years and years ago,
five this very night, you were stranded on the beach
down here?"
</p>

<p>
"Stlanded!  What does that mean, daddy?"
</p>

<p>
"Thrown up by the waves, my wee one."
</p>

<p>
Toddie was looking at him now with eyes that were
very wide indeed.
</p>

<p>
"What, daddy, dust the same as the Johnnie whale,
daddy?"
</p>

<p>
"Just the same as the Johnnie whale, dear."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
She nestled towards him now, and gazed thoughtfully
at the fire, and the old bard talked to her and to the
fire at the same time apparently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Toddie, it was a fearful night that.  There was
a moon, but she hadn't a chance of shining; for the
grey-black clouds dashed over her like the race of a
mill-stream.  Early in the afternoon a brig had been
seen trying to round the point.  But the wind blew
high, and, alas! she tried in vain.  We had all been on
the beach for hours and hours watching her.  Oh, what
an evening it was!  There had been sea-gulls in our
garden that day, darling, as tame as chickens."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"And we knew, Toddie, something terrible would
soon happen.  Mammy had hot water and blankets
ready ever so long.  Then the brig struck.  Long
before then Bunko had been sent off on horseback to
warn a lifeboat.  But the lifeboat never came.  And
small matter that she didn't.  Hours after a spar
floated up.  We saw something white lashed to it, and
all rushed to pick it up.  I was first, and found you,
Toddie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"Mammy Mop took hours to bring you back to life.
We have the old spar yet in the sail-house; it was
loaded with iron&mdash;old axe heads&mdash;to make a keel; so,
Toddie, you floated face upwards.  That is the way
you came, Toddie."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Dear little Treasure-trove.  I hope you will not
be taken from me."
</p>

<p>
He gathered her closer up to him.
</p>

<p>
"Sing now," she murmured, "sing soft and low, like
mammy does."
</p>

<p>
He sat rocking her there, and singing low, sweet
Scotch hits, till her regular breathing and closed eyes
told him she was fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
Then he gently laid her on the bench, while he put
on his plaid.
</p>

<p>
Every moment now the waves dashed high over the
ports of the cave, and the wind shrieked like the voices
of creatures in pain or despair.
</p>

<p>
Quietly he takes the sleeping Toddie up, and wraps
her in the plaid folds close to his breast.  "Come, Tip,"
he says, and crook in hand goes up the steps and
struggles out into the storm and darkness.
</p>

<p>
On nights like this Eppie always had a light burning
in her gable window to guide belated boats, and
this was the star old Eean steered by.
</p>

<p>
"Praise be to Providence you've come," said Eppie.
"D'ye mind what nicht this is?"
</p>

<p>
"Right well I do," said Eean.  "Look at the innocent
lamb.  Take her gently, Eppie.  Take her gently."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
When Fred went in with a rush next morning to the
room where Toddie slept in a tiny cot, wondering why
she had not come down to breakfast, he found the
little maiden standing half-dressed before her little
mirror, with a thumb in her mouth.
</p>

<p>
I dare say she had little womanly ways about her,
else she would not have been in front of that morsel
of mirror.  But the thumb in the mouth showed how
deep in thought she was.
</p>

<p>
"Thinking again, Toddie."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'se finking, Fred.  Cause, you know, last
night I was in Daddy's cave, or was I dleaming?"
</p>

<p>
"You must have been dreaming, Todd."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I must have been dleaming, Fred.  And I
dleamt that Daddy told me a stoly, that Daddy said
I came ashole on the beach, dust the same as the
Johnnie whale."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br><br>
PLEASANT SURPRISES&mdash;FRANK'S YACHT&mdash;THE LAUNCH OF<br>
THE WATER-BABY.
</h3>

<p>
Winter had come and gone again, and a
very hard one it had been.  Of the ten
boats that belonged to the bay, and were
laid up when not in use in a rock-girt
harbour, about half a mile from the
village, few had gone out very often.  But
seldom a day passed that Eean's boat, the <i>Treasure-trove</i>
was not seen scudding about somewhere, if wind
and weather permitted; and always when Daddy went
to sea&mdash;and this was no means seldom&mdash;the two
children went with him, so that Fred had generally
one complete holiday every week.
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed that Eean was careless
with regard to the boy's education on this account.
No, indeed.  Fred's day at sea was one of real utility,
and, young though he was, he knew already how to
handle the great boat, and how to steer as well.
Toddie too was a capital young sailor lass.  She was
warmly clad; but though her brave little face might
be red, or even almost blue, she never feared to look
a storm in the teeth.
</p>

<p>
Frank had gone away south with his mother to
attend a purely English school, for sake of <i>bon ton</i> and
the pure English accent.  But the children
corresponded regularly.
</p>

<p>
Toddie's letters to Frank were marvels in their way.
She could not write very distinctly, so every
alphabetical letter was pen-printed.
</p>

<p>
Frank had not much to tell.  His life he was sorry
to say was a very humdrum one.  He was at a very
humdrum school, where the pupils, all "sons of
gentlemen," were allowed to do pretty much as they
pleased.  When they fell behind or lazed it was put
down to delicate health.  The bold forcing system of
the Scottish Church parish schools was unknown at
the so-called college at which Frank was engaged in
his so-called studies.
</p>

<p>
His dear mamma spent the winter in the south, that
she might be near to her dear boy and only son.  She
even told the head-teacher, or rather proprietor, of
the school that her boy was not in robust health, and
that he must on no account be thwarted.  The fact is,
Frank was as hardy and manly a lad as there was at
the college.
</p>

<p>
He went home to his mother's house every Friday
evening, and Fred's letter came punctually every
Saturday afternoon, with wee Toddie's printed scrawl
enclosed.  Toddie's scrawls were really love letters of
a sort, and not badly put together on the whole, as
regards composition.  Daddy spelt every word for her,
which she herself could not manage.  Here is a brief
extract, which shows really that she could write better
than she could speak:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"I thinks lots about you, Flank, in my bed and on
the beach.  I dont love the winter, I loves the summer,
cause there is plenty flowers and no chilblains.  I loves
Daddy and Mammy Mop best, then Fred then Tippetty,
then my dolly fishes, and then Flank last, but O Flank
the last is a big big much.
</p>

<p class="letter">
  "Your 'ffection' friend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Toddie Treasure-Trove."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mrs. Fielding really was a good-hearted lady in the
main, but purse-proud, and not over deep in mind.
</p>

<p>
She always spoke of Frank's little friends as "those
poor children."  This used to make Frank angry, though
he loved his mother too much to show it.  Well,
Mrs. Fielding was also generous.  She had proposed sending
"those poor children" some clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother, don't!" Frank had gasped, getting
dreadfully red in the face.
</p>

<p>
Frank's father was reading the newspaper.  He held
it down for a minute to smile and say:
</p>

<p>
"Frank's right, mamma.  It would be taken as a
terrible insult.  You forget that Eean Arundel is a
gentleman though poor.  My countrymen," he added,
laughing, "are all gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"Well," Mrs Fielding had replied, "I don't care much
for pride in people who have nothing to keep it up with."
</p>

<p>
Young Frank was thoroughly roused now.  He had
to keep striding up and down across the floor to
restrain his feelings.
</p>

<p>
"Mother," he said at last, "they have honesty."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "A king can mak' a belted knight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A marquis, duke, and a' that;<br>
  An honest man's above his might."<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Frank went and kissed his mother, and then ran
straight out of the room.
</p>

<p>
Now Fred and Toddie, arrayed in their best, had
several times visited at the house of Benshee.  Frank
had driven them over, and Fred at Frank's request had
always brought his flute.  For a boy of his years he
was a charming performer.  Frank played a little trick
upon his lady mother.  He went into her studio, which
abutted on to the lawn, leaving Fred behind a bush
near to the open window.
</p>

<p>
When Frank was fairly seated beside his mother,
Fred began to play one of those sweet, sad Scottish
melodies, that can draw tears to the eyes of even an
English audience.  Frank kept talking to his mother;
but he was soon silenced.
</p>

<p>
"Hush! hush, boy!" she cried.  "Have you no ear
for the beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
She sighed when the air died in cadence away.
</p>

<p>
"Some poor tramp," said the lady.  "Run, Frank, and
give him sixpence."
</p>

<p>
But Fred now appeared at the window, laughing and
holding out his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you dear lad," cried Mrs. Fielding, "come
and kiss me!"
</p>

<p>
Fred did as told; but not quite so gracefully as an
English boy would have done.  Only this episode
supplied Mrs. Fielding with an idea for being generous
without offering insult.
</p>

<p>
One day, therefore, while Eppie was preparing a nice
creel of fresh lobsters to be taken by Bunko to a
neighbouring village, she was greatly surprised to find
the carrier's cart from T&mdash;&mdash; draw up at her door.
The cart contained a large and wonderful-looking box.
If it had not been addressed in a clear hand to
"Master Fred Arundel," Eppie would have thought
there must be some mistake.
</p>

<p>
She did not dare to look into it until Fred came
from school, and Daddy from his cave; and then, I do
believe, half the village came to see the opening of
that box.
</p>

<p>
It contained, to the amazement of all, a charming
little piano.  Toddie's face was a study at this
disclosure; and Frank's was a picture of mingled pride
and joy.  As there was but little room in the house,
the piano was taken to the cave; a damp-proof
covering being made for it, lest it should be injured
by the air of the sea.
</p>

<p>
All through the winter after school-hours, and after
lessons at home, Fred had studied systematically on his
new instrument.  Playing was one of Eean's accomplishments,
and Fred proved so apt a pupil that it was
soon evident he possessed the gift of music.
</p>

<p>
And now spring had come.  The larch trees were
already green, and tasselled over with crimson; primroses
and violets peeped out in sheltered places, larks
sang their glad lilts high in air; the pigeons croodled
low in the spruce thickets; but the mavis seemed to
have gone out of his mind, so madly and merrily did
he sing.  The sea was often calm now, and the sky
very blue, though the heaving swell of the great
Atlantic broke in thunders on the beach.
</p>

<p>
And one day Fred came rushing in from meeting the
post-runner, waving a letter over his head, and Tip
barking at his heels.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" he cried; "Frank's coming."
</p>

<p>
There was real joy now in the fisherman's cottage.
</p>

<p>
But that night, after the children had gone to bed,
Eean and Eppie sat beside the fire to consider solemnly
a letter of another kind.
</p>

<p>
It was from Mrs. Fielding.  It was like Mrs. Fielding.
It was written in all sincerity; but was
a very thunderbolt to poor Eean.
</p>

<p>
She had proposed to adopt Fred as a companion to
her boy, and bring him up as her own son, giving him
a good start in life.
</p>

<p>
They talked the matter out from every point of
view.  The Fieldings were rich.  They could give the
lad a good start in life.  Though it would break their
hearts to lose him, and Toddie's heart too, was it right
of them to be selfish?  Would it not be best for the
boy if they accepted?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps; but then perhaps not.  Riches do not
always bring success in life, and mixing in society
that he was but little used to might alter all the lad's
character, and spoil him for life.
</p>

<p>
For two long hours they talked and talked.  Then
Eean rose.
</p>

<p>
"Let us simply pray for God's guidance, Eppie."
</p>

<p>
And side by side they knelt, while Eean lifted up
his open eyes and prayed.
</p>

<p>
Next morning Eean seemed to receive an inspiration;
all that was doubtful the evening before seemed clear
as day now.
</p>

<p>
"We'll leave it to the boy," he said.
</p>

<p>
"You like Frank very much, don't you?" Eean said
to Fred after breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very much!"
</p>

<p>
"He is very happy, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Happy, daddy?  I don't know.  O yes, I suppose so."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to be rich just as he is?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm so very happy you know, daddy, and I've so
much to do, I never thought of that.  And I have so
much to learn too.
</p>

<p>
"O daddy," continued the boy after a pause, "poor
Frank's letters almost make me cry sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Now you surprise me.  But I'm going to the cave,
so come along and tell me all about it."
</p>

<p>
When seated by the open port&mdash;"You see, daddy,"
said Fred, "Frank really wants to learn things all the
time; and at the school he is at there are so many
holidays, and they get so much of their own way, and
so much time is spent at football and cricket, that they
have no leisure to learn much.  But, you see, he won't
require to be well educated, because he is rich.  Will he,
daddy?"
</p>

<p>
Eean laughed at this idea.
</p>

<p>
"And," continued Fred, "he would hardly believe
me when I showed him my Latin and Greek exercises,
and my books on algebra and history.  And he bit his
lip and grew red, and the tears came rushing into his
eyes, daddy.  And, O Daddy Pop, though he writes in
English, <i>he can't spell</i>."
</p>

<p>
Fred was almost breaking down here in boyish grief
for his friend.
</p>

<p>
Now was Eean's time.  He took Mrs. Fielding's
letter from his pocket and placed it in the boy's hand.
</p>

<p>
"It is very good of her," was all the poet said as he
did so.
</p>

<p>
Eean watched him as he read.  Sometimes Fred's
colour heightened, and sometimes his pupils dilated,
as if he saw not the letter before him.
</p>

<p>
"What, daddy, leave you and Mammy Mop and
Toddie and Tippetty&mdash;and my books?  Oh, Daddy Pop!"
</p>

<p>
"And what have you done about it, Pop?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Mop and I talked hours about it; then we prayed
to the Good God, Fred."
</p>

<p>
"What did the Good God say, Daddy Pop?"
</p>

<p>
"He bade me leave it all to you, dear lad."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha!" laughed the boy.  "I'm so glad."
</p>

<p>
Then a funny notion came into his mind, which he
proceeded at once to put into execution.
</p>

<p>
"Daddy," he said, "you left it to me.  I'll leave it
to the Corsican Brothers."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he deftly tied a bit of meat to the
string, and lowered it into the sea with a plash; about
a minute after up over the ledge straddled the Corsican
Brothers&mdash;Eean's pet crabs.  They knew Fred, and at
once advanced.  Fred gave them a morsel or two of
food to whet their appetite, and not to deceive them;
then the boy assumed a semi-theatrical attitude, and
addressed them.
</p>

<p>
"We have a very knotty point to solve, my dear
twins," he said; "and Pop says I may leave it to you.
Read that letter."
</p>

<p>
Both crabs seized it at once.  They thought it the
biggest piece of white meat ever they had turned their
stalky eyes upon.  But finding it flavourless and
unprofitable they lost their tempers, and tore it into
shreds.  So indignant did they appear, they even
clawed up the pieces and tore them over again.
</p>

<p>
Then Fred brushed away the paper and gave the
Corsican Brothers a bigger feed than ever they had
enjoyed in their lives before.
</p>

<p>
So that was an end to Mrs. Fielding's kind, but
somewhat thoughtless proposal.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
When Frank called in his pony-trap he found Fred
in his shirt sleeves, with a plane in his hand, and hard
at work.  He was making a table for the igloo, for
carpentering was one of his chief hobbies.  On the
table near him lay a Greek grammar.  He was
conjugating the irregular verbs, while he sent the
curling shavings flying all over Toddie and Tippetty,
who were having fine fun on the floor.
</p>

<p>
That meeting was a very joyful one.  There was
much to say and much to be told on both sides.
</p>

<p>
Instead of going to the woods to-day the children
got the cobble, and went off round the point fishing.
</p>

<p>
Frank's most interesting bit of news was embodied
in the following words:
</p>

<p>
"I've been reading <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>," he said, "and
I'd like to be a sailor.  And what do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't guess," said Fred.  "Toddie, put the
helm down a bit, the wind is shifting."
</p>

<p>
They had a sail on the cobble, and Toddie was
bravely steering.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my mother has bought me a nice boat, and
we are to keep it here in a boat-house.  The boat is
higher in the sides than this."
</p>

<p>
"Higher free-board," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
"And not quite so wide."
</p>

<p>
"Bloader in the beam oo means to say," said Toddie
with a slight curl on her lip.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know all that, Toddie?" said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" cried Toddie.  "Tan't oo see I'se steeling
[steering].  Oo must not talk to the man at the
wheel."
</p>

<p>
Fred's eyes began to beam, as they always did when
he caught up some new idea.
</p>

<p>
"O Frank," he cried, "I know what we can do.  But
what size is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me see.  She must be yards and yards long."
</p>

<p>
Toddie began to laugh, and so did Fred.  Poor Frank
was no sailor.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Frank.  I daresay she is big enough to
deck over and step a mast in, and make a yacht of.
Bunko and I can do it.  You have no idea how clever
Bunko is.  And I have tools and wood and all."
</p>

<p>
In less than a week the boat came round, and was
stabled, as Frank called it, in a boat-house on the
beach.  The boys could do what they liked with the
boat, was Mrs. Fielding's request; but they must
always have a man with a lifebuoy close beside them
in another boat at sea.
</p>

<p>
Bunko took the village cows to the hill; but all
day long the faithful collie Keelie watched them.  The
dog made a rapid run homeward every day, ate his
dinner, which was always ready, then back to the hills
he would scud again.  So until eventide, when he went
to take home his charge, Bunko's time was very much
his own.
</p>

<p>
The decking and fitting out of the yacht, therefore,
proceeded merrily enough.  A fresh keel was put on
her, and a good one too.  Eean himself had seen to
this.  The mainsail was only a storm one, there was
no topsail, and just a single jib.  The rudder was very
safely shipped, and so, though the boys did most of the
work, Eean was the real ship-builder, and safety was
consulted in every detail.
</p>

<p>
When all was complete, and the craft painted and
furnished, a more complete little boys' yacht it would
have been difficult to conceive.
</p>

<p>
The fishermen all said she was a perfect picture, and
lay like a duck on the water, with a good many other
complimentary allusions, all of which were Greek to
Frank, but not to Toddie and Fred.
</p>

<p>
No expense was spared in the upholstering of the
little cabin, and they even had a small galley, with a
tiny spirit range, enough to make tea and boil eggs.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a proud day for the boys, and Toddie
and Tippetty, when they went for their first sail.
</p>

<p>
Their consort was a big cobble with a fisherman to
row, and a silly sort of a sailor-fellow with a lifebuoy.
</p>

<p>
The villagers gathered down by the beach and
natural harbour, to give them a cheer when they
started away on their trial trip, with their saucy
little red flag floating at the peak.
</p>

<p>
Her name was the <i>Water Baby</i>, and with great
pomp and ceremony she had been duly christened by
Toddie, a tiny bottle of eau de Cologne, brought by
Frank, having been duly broken on her bows before
she left the slip.
</p>

<p>
One day Mrs. Fielding herself went for a sail, and
found it so perfectly safe that at Frank's earnest
request she allowed them in future to dispense with
the consort cobble, and the sailor-fellow also.
</p>

<p>
But they had to carry a lifebuoy nevertheless, and
this was only right.
</p>

<p>
Boy though he was, Fred knew something about the
signs of the weather, and always got into harbour in
time to avoid a storm, or anything like one.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
So spring merged into summer; the days grew
warmer and longer, and the sea more calm and bright.
Then Fred's summer holidays came round; and happier
children than those three, Frank, Fred, and Toddie,
were surely not to be found in all broad Scotland.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br><br>
PLAYING AT BEING PIRATES&mdash;A STORM AT<br>
SEA&mdash;THE WRECK.
</h3>

<p>
Frank Fielding's life was not quite like
his friend Fred's in one particular; for
Frank could always have a holiday when he
wanted one.  His father was an easy-going,
non-ambitious man; he possessed all the
comforts of this world, and very much
enjoyed them.  If you had asked him about his son's
prospects in life, he would have told you that he was
pleased enough to let the boy enjoy himself; that very
likely there was a career of some kind before him
when he developed; but that meanwhile he left all his
educational affairs to his&mdash;the boy's&mdash;mother.
</p>

<p>
Poor Frank!  The mother might have been doing
her best, but to keep constantly sending a lad from
school to school was not advancing his interests.
</p>

<p>
Fred had only the regular holiday given at Scottish
schools, the summer one being the chief, and indeed
the only one worthy of the name, because it lasted for
six weeks.
</p>

<p>
Well, anyhow, Frank had found a companion after
his own heart, and Fred had found a real friend.  It
was almost strange, a psychologist would have thought,
how very much those two lads had come to love each
other in so short a time.  It was in a good many ways
a case of extremes meeting, but they had a deal in
common nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
Both loved Nature most ardently, although Fred
knew ten times more about the habits of the wanderers
in wood and field than did Frank.  Every wild flower
he met was an old acquaintance of Fred's, and so was
every bird that sang or did not sing.
</p>

<p>
Fred was a great bird-nester.  But, mark this, he
never took a single egg, far, far less a helpless fledgling.
But he knew where they all built their nests or laid
their eggs without ever bothering about building a
nest, in forest, in mountain, on moorland, or by stream.
There was no pine tree or larch high enough to prevent
Fred from getting to the top thereof, and in Scotland
these trees are at home, and grow their very tallest.
He and Toddie had other friends in the wilds as
well as birds, so numerous indeed that I begrudge
space in which to name them.  But there were bees
of all kinds, and beetles of every hue and shape;
there were frogs and toads, charming lizards and
lovely great snakes.  Not adders.  Even in the heather
Toddie was as often barefooted as not, because she
preferred "feelin' around with her foots as Tippetty
did."  So she said, and Eean would not thwart her.
</p>

<p>
Well, during the holidays they had many a long day
in the woods and wilds; other days were spent at sea
in the yacht, where they played at being pirates, and ran
down and pretended to capture fishing-boats, and once
they even overhauled a Royal Navy cutter that was
dodging off the point.  Fred lowered sail and boarded
her, and when asked what he wanted, he boldly pointed
to a black flag with skull and cross bones that Frank
had hoisted; told the bos'n he was "The Pirate of the
Western Wilds," and he must submit to give up his
craft and walk the plank.  There was no little laughing
at this; but finally the <i>Water Baby</i> was taken in tow,
and the children spent a downright madcap afternoon
with the sailors on board the cutter.
</p>

<p>
When it was getting near sunset farewells were said,
and over the side went the pirates bold, the men giving
them three cheers as their fairy-like yacht bore away
for Methlin Bay.
</p>

<p>
Once it was caught in a puff of wind, and had to
run for harbour; but the way Frank and Fred took in
sail was a pretty sight indeed, while Toddie sat at the
tiller with Tippie at her side.
</p>

<p>
Oh, I can assure you this playing pirate was fine fun!
But I think, on the whole, Frank had more sense of
the humorous than had Fred.  He took a less serious
view of life in general, and was always up to some lark
or another.  Once, for instance, he met Bunko in a
neighbouring village with a creel of lovely lobsters, and,
right or wrong, Frank must have that creel, and did
have it, and, with Fred and Toddie following up in the
rear, he marched boldly through the little country town,
crying, "Lobsters, all alive O!"  They were all dead
and boiled, but that didn't matter.  Frank&mdash;a laird's
son&mdash;selling lobsters!  Every woman and child ran out
to see him, and in half an hour he had sold the lot.
</p>

<p>
How proud he was of his success! and how Bunko
did laugh to be sure!
</p>

<p>
Now Frank did not wear the ordinary Highland garb
such as gentlemen wear while shooting or fishing.  It
pleased his mother to put him into a real tartan kilt,
with black jacket of velvet, skean dhu and sporran, so
you may fancy what sort of a figure he cut with a
creel on his back.  But it wasn't all over yet; for,
another day he actually bought a creel for himself,
and having made some private arrangement with
Bunko, the two set off together to see who would sell
out the sooner.
</p>

<p>
Fred and Toddie were there as usual; but, lo and
behold! just in the midst of the fun, who should drive up
the street but his father and mother in the landau.
</p>

<p>
Not a bit taken aback, Frank walked right up to the
carriage.
</p>

<p>
"Buy any beautiful lobsters to-day, madam?" he
said, with true fisher "twang."
</p>

<p>
The lobsters were red, but Mrs. Fielding's face grew
redder.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank!  Frank!" she cried, "how could you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Quite fresh, madam, I assure you.  Only boiled
this morning.  Feel the weight of this one, my lady."
</p>

<p>
His father could hardly speak for laughing, and
the coachman's fat sides shook till he nearly fell off
the dickey.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Fielding himself bought that lobster, and the
carriage drove on.
</p>

<p>
Frank looked after it with a very comical expression
on his face.
</p>

<p>
Then he laughed as he turned to Fred.
</p>

<p>
"I shall have that lobster to-night for supper," ha
said, "and such a wigging with it from mother, you
know.  Father is fond of fun.  Come on, Bunko.  'A
man's a man for a' that.'  Lobsters, all alive O!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"I fink," said Toddie one morning as she stood
looking at the sea with her thumb in her mouth, "I
fink, Fled, it will blow a ten-knot bleeze to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Fred, with a glance at the sky as if he
had been a hundred-years-old fisherman, "it may blow
a ten-knot breeze, but bless you, Tod, we haven't got
the press of canvas to carry us anything like ten
knots."
</p>

<p>
"No, oo's twite light [right], Fled, we tan't do it.
We tould tally more tanvas too."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Tod, don't put on airs.  Skip.  Frank'll be
here in a minute."
</p>

<p>
Toddie and Tip did skip, and after running stark
staring mad on the sands for a quarter of an hour they
went to say "Dood-bye to the tsilden dolly fishes" in
the aquarium.
</p>

<p>
The blennies were waiting to be stroked, and all
waiting to be fed.
</p>

<p>
"Dood-bye, dolly-fishes;" cried Toddie, waving her
hand as she stood in the cave mouth.  "Be dood
tsilden till oo mammy tomes back, and oo'll all have
something nice."
</p>

<p>
Frank was careering over the sands on the Shetland
pony looking for Toddie, and he gave her just one wild
gallop before they embarked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go far out to-day, bairns," cried Eean.  "I'm
not sure it isn't going to blow, bright and all as it is.
And the breeze is off the land too."
</p>

<p>
After they had made a good offing, Fred said,
"Let us stand right away to the west for a few
miles, then tack back.  That'll make a nice long sail
of it."
</p>

<p>
The breeze was very light, and they were about five
miles from the coast in an hour, a long way decidedly
for children to be out on an uncertain day, albeit two
of them were children of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Fred now had the mainsail lowered, and they just
kept moving while Frank made coffee, and undid a
package containing a splendid veal-pie.
</p>

<p>
What a delightful feast that was!  And the sea and
sky and shore looked somehow even more lovely after
their hearty meal than they had done before.  Even Tip
must have thought so too; for he stood with his two
fat feet on the gunwale, and barked in a daft kind of
way at the sea-gulls.
</p>

<p>
What glorious tints of blue and opal and purple
and green overspread seascape and landscape!
</p>

<p>
They were looking at all this in a dreamy happy
way, when Fred suddenly pointed towards the mountains.
"Look! look!" he cried, "at those great white
clouds rising like giant's heads, looking over the hills."
</p>

<p>
"Dust like diants," said Toddie.
</p>

<p>
"Let her come round, Todd.  Thank you."
</p>

<p>
The mainsail was hoisted, and she came round like a
swan.
</p>

<p>
Tippetty was sent below, and Toddie too, and Fred
took the tiller himself.
</p>

<p>
In less than half-an-hour the storm was over them.
Fred saw it coming, and knew he couldn't face it, and
so got round to scud all in good time.
</p>

<p>
The wind had gone round points and points, and
the wee yacht fairly flew before it, lying over till the
gunwale nearly touched the water&mdash;aye, and did at
times.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid, Todd," shouted Fred, laughing.
"It will soon be over.  Cheer up, Frank!"
</p>

<p>
Honest Fred! he knew the danger they were in, but
kept the secret to himself.
</p>

<p>
Well, the <i>Water Baby</i> proved a grand little sailer.
Fred really felt proud of her as she rose so nimbly to
each green sea, and dashed the spray from her bows.
</p>

<p>
He would have been happy but for thinking of the
anxiety of those at home.  However, he managed to
keep Toddie in the dry; and Frank and he got their
oilskins and sou'-westers, and perfect little tars they
looked now.
</p>

<p>
In about an hour they were far away at sea and no
land in sight; but the wind had settled down to a
steady blow, the seas raced up behind them, the sails
were as stiff as pasteboard, and all danger seemed past.
</p>

<p>
"Aren't we going from home rather?" said Frank.
Fred laughed, though he felt it was rude.
</p>

<p>
"We can't beat," said Fred, "we must run; but we've
no cloth to speak of."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said Frank, "it is well to know that."
</p>

<p>
"I mean, you know, it is impossible to get back till
this bit of a summer puff blows over.  All right down
there, Toddie?"
</p>

<p>
No answer.  Toddie and Tip were fast asleep on the
cushions.
</p>

<p>
Frank began to nod next, and finally collapsed, half
in half out, of the little cabin.  Fred pulled a tarpaulin
over him, and then felt very lonely indeed.
</p>

<p>
It must be remembered Fred was only a youngster,
though strong for his age.  One thing anyhow I am
quite sure of, he was not afraid; a better sailor he
might have been, but fear&mdash;no.
</p>

<p>
Westward and westward with a bit of south in
it went the <i>Water Baby</i> all day long.
</p>

<p>
Just as it was getting near to gloaming a haze spread
over the ocean, obscuring everything except the green
seas close aboard.  Fred did not like this new turn of
events.  He liked it less when suddenly dark rocks
loomed like gigantic black castles over him&mdash;over him&mdash;on
both sides&mdash;around him.  Swish!  Crack!  Dash!  The
yacht had run on shore, and the mast went by the board.
</p>

<p>
The seas hissed around the wreck&mdash;if wreck she was&mdash;like
snakes, but a big kindly wave at last came sweeping
on, and lifted the <i>Water Baby</i> high and dry on the sands.
</p>

<p>
Fred knew it was high-water just then, so there was
no more danger to be apprehended.
</p>

<p>
Somehow or other the <i>Water Baby</i> lay on an even keel,
with the wreck of the mast and the tattered sail astern
of her.  Frank was certainly frightened.  It was a terrible
awaking for anyone; but it might have been worse.
</p>

<p>
"I fell asleep sayin' my players," said Toddie, emerging
from the cabin.  "And poor Tippetty are both so hungly."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know where you are, Toddie?" said Fred,
taking the child on his knee.  There was little else to
be done, he thought, but nurse Toddie, and he was so
very, very tired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, of course I do!  We is all shipwlecked
maliners now."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Toddie, don't sleep again.  Let us get on shore
for a run.  Perhaps there is a house somewhere near."
</p>

<p>
A reddish mist appeared seawards, between the giant
rocks they had been so fortunate as to escape, and
Fred knew the sun had set.
</p>

<p>
The wind appeared going down with it too, so his
spirits rose.
</p>

<p>
It was only a small island after all.  They searched
about and called and shouted, but no sound or sight of
human life could be discovered; so they returned
together towards the little cove, and prepared to make
the best of it.
</p>

<p>
"Get on board, Frank, and light the lamp, and boil
some water for tea.  Toddie and I will go and gather
dulse."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Captain Fred," said Frank, who really
appeared now to be enamoured of their romantic
situation.
</p>

<p>
When Toddie and Tippie and Fred got back from
the beach it was nearly dark; but the little cabin
seemed quite cosy, and after some delicious tea, and
the rest of the pie, they all felt as happy as happy
could be.
</p>

<p>
They had books in the cabin, and so Fred volunteered
to read a story, after talking for some hours.  The
story was one of their favourites&mdash;<i>Sinbad the Sailor</i>.
</p>

<p>
It must have been long past nine when Toddie
began to nod; so Fred put her to sleep with Tip on the
little sofa, and covered her over with a plaid.
</p>

<p>
By this time the wind had quite gone down; so
after a turn on deck, as Fred phrased it, the boys went
below and turned in all standing.  More of Fred's
phraseology, meaning that they lay down on the floor
with their clothes on.  And the sun had risen, and
was shining yellow into the cabin before they ever
moved again.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br><br>
ON THE DESERT ISLAND&mdash;TODDIE'S ADVENTURE ON THE<br>
CLIFF&mdash;THE BONFIRE.
</h3>

<p>
What a gladsome, joyous morning!  And
how brimful of health and happiness were
those two lads, Fred and Frank!  Both
seemed to wake at once; then they
looked in each other's faces, blinked a
little in that yellow ray of sunshine, then
burst out laughing.
</p>

<p>
In about five and a half seconds, as nearly as I can
judge, they were both on deck rubbing their eyes and
looking about them.
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it famous?" cried Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's grand!"
</p>

<p>
"But I say, you know, what about my mamma and
your Mammy Mop?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that'll be alright!  Daddy and mammy are so
sensible, both of them."
</p>

<p>
"So are mine, but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, they know I'm not.  They haven't forgotten
those lobsters yet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to forget everything as much as I can.
I have my wee sister to comfort and see after.  Daddy
will pray for us, and then he'll be content and happy."
</p>

<p>
"I say, are you hungry?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; so now I'm Captain Fred, and you're my
lieutenant."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, captain, you're Crusoe, and I'm your man
Friday."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Friday, bustle about and get ready breakfast;
cook down there by that rock, and I'll see to the Fairy
Queen&mdash;Toddie, you know."
</p>

<p>
Now there was going to be no starvation for some
days to come, if indeed they were not rescued before
then.  Fred had always an eye to eventualities, and he
had had the little yacht stored with biscuits and
preserved meats and milk in tins.  Frank had insisted
on paying for all his stores, as he was owner,
though Fred was sailing master.
</p>

<p>
Down below went Fred.  Toddie was still sound
asleep, and as for Tip, who lay in her arms, he would
have slept for two days if his little mistress but lay
still.  Fred did not wake her just yet.
</p>

<p>
It had just occurred to him that there was scarcely
a drop of water in the ship.  This was terrible, for
perhaps there was none in the island.
</p>

<p>
But then they had seen sheep.  Oh, there must be
water!
</p>

<p>
So off the boys went with a can to explore.  There
were no savages on the island, and so Toddie would be
safe.  They found a patch of scraggy bushes near a
rock.  A great striped snake wriggled away, and then
Fred felt sure there was water near by.
</p>

<p>
Yes, trickling out of a rock, a lovely wee crystal rill.
How sweet and cool it was!  Both drank and felt refreshed.
They filled the can and hurried back to the ship.
</p>

<p>
Fred got a nice basin of the cool water, a towel and
soap, and descended once more to the cabin.
</p>

<p>
To his dismay, Toddie was gone! and Tip was gone!
For a moment he was bewildered; then he called
Frank, and off they ran all round and up and down
the island, which was certainly not a large one.  They
shouted again and again, but there was no answer.
At long last though, they saw Tippetty at some distance,
standing with his paws on the very edge of a dizzy
cliff, looking over.
</p>

<p>
Fred's eyes felt starting from the sockets with fear.
He did not even notice that poor Frank had fainted
and fallen on the green turf.
</p>

<p>
On and on towards Tip went Fred&mdash;slowly, silently,
his hands stretched in front of him&mdash;walking as one
dreams of walking in a terrible nightmare.
</p>

<p>
At last&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;Tip started away from the cliff
with a joyful bark, and next moment, catching by a
scraggy bush, Toddie pulled herself up, and quite laden
with a curious kind of mauve stonecrop, came rushing
to meet her foster-brother.
</p>

<p>
Fred clasped her in his arms, kissed her face, and
burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Toddie could not quite understand the terrible
danger she had been in, nor the extent of the fright
she had given them, till they found Frank.  He was
just reviving.
</p>

<p>
"So foolish to faint," he said sleepily.
</p>

<p>
"Oo is vely, vely white," Toddie said.  "O Flank,
I'se been a naughty dirl!"
</p>

<p>
"You are safe, Toddie.  Come."
</p>

<p>
Toddie went and sat by him a short time, and made
him laugh at last; then the boys made a "Queen's
chair" by interlacing their hands.  Toddie sat thereon,
and thus, laughing and running, they returned to the
cove, Tip barking round them all the time.
</p>

<p>
Toddie promised faithfully not to go near the terrible
cliff again, so happiness was completely restored.
</p>

<p>
How they did enjoy that breakfast to be sure!  But
they could not sit there all day, so up they got at last.
Toddie took off her stockings and shoes, and rolled up
her sleeves, and commenced at once to wash up and
clear away, while Crusoe and his man Friday went to
examine the yacht.  She was deeply imbedded in the
soft sand, but her bottom was found to be sound, though
doubtless she would leak when floated again.  The sails
were intact, but the mast had gone by the board.
</p>

<p>
So they unloosed the former and spread them out to
dry, and hauled the mast out of reach of the water.
Then down they sat to consider their position, while
Toddie, having tidied herself and done up the cabin,
went to paddle on the beach with Tip.  Fred was full
of resources.
</p>

<p>
Frank was more full of fun than anything else.
</p>

<p>
"Have you anything to propose, Friday?" said Fred
seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Frank, "I propose that I should listen
and nod my head to all you say.  I'm only a nigger
you know, a black irreclaimable savage."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know this island is only a solitary patch
in the middle of the sea, and there are hardly any
others visible; but I think, you know, we could float
the <i>Water Baby</i> and rig the broken mast as a jury."
</p>

<p>
"You're the best <i>judge</i>," said Frank, "so it will be
judge and jury."
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet, Friday; how dare you, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"All right, sah, I'se goin' to be quiet and
circumspecful like."
</p>

<p>
"We haven't a spade, but we have an axe," said Fred;
"and I saw some old spars up there, so we could soon
make a spade, no, two spades.  Then we could dig
away the sand all round her at low-water, and at
high-water she would float; then we could shove off, and if
the wind would favour us, we could steer for the east,
and get home all right.  I really think it can be
managed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, look, look!" cried Friday.  "Why it's a goat!
Oh, if we could only learn him to dance, what fun
it would be, massa Crusoe!"
</p>

<p>
Then up jumped Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Tip, Tip, Tip," he cried.  "Toddie, Toddie, Toddie."
</p>

<p>
And the wild wee maiden with her daft wee doggie
came bounding to the call.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going for an explore," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"But our work?" said Fred.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother the work, that can wait!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, we can all go for a little while.  Put on your
stockings and shoes, Tod."
</p>

<p>
Toddie gladly did as she was told, and away the
shipwrecked mariners went.  There was a high bit
of ground, almost a hill in fact, in the centre of the
island, and they climbed this first.  They found a goat
and two kids up here, but they went bounding away
like red deer.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they can be taught to dance, massa
Crusoe," remarked Frank.
</p>

<p>
"I fear not, Friday."
</p>

<p>
From the hill they could see all "wound the world,"
as Toddie phrased it.  What a beautiful world it was
too, a world of peaceful blue waters, a world of blue
sky, fleecy cloudlets and sunshine, but apparently a
world of lonesomeness!  They could barely see the
mainland, and they could just make out some islands
lying far away to the west, with one steamboat, the
smoke trailing like a dark snake far in the rear, but
never a ship was there to be seen, and not even a boat.
</p>

<p>
As they were gazing westwards Toddie noticed a
fountain of white spray rise up out of the blue water,
and presently another.  She clapped her hands with
delight.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she cried, "it is a Johnnie whale!"
</p>

<p>
And the Johnnie whale came nearer and nearer till
they could see his huge bulk rising and falling in the
sea.
</p>

<p>
Soon after a merry shoal of porpoises passed close to
the island.  They were leaping out of the water, and
even cooing in their joy.  But Toddie's thoughts and
sympathies were with that Johnnie whale.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she said, as if the whale could hear her,
"don't tome near the shole, Johnnie.  Swim home, oo
silly whale, oo mammy will die if she never sees oo
any more."
</p>

<p>
The children walked all round the cliff edge.  They
found one other bay or harbour, but with the exception
of this and the cove into which the little yacht had
been so providentially thrown, the shores of this island
presented to the waves a dark and impenetrable barrier.
They explored the little harbour.  There were the
ashes of a fire that had long, long been extinguished,
but no mark of a single footprint in the sand to show
that any boat had been recently here.  So they went
slowly back to their yacht.  The sea-birds screaming
in myriads about them, and the wild rabbits here and
there on the stone-covered sides of grey hillocks standing
up on their hind legs and wonderingly looking at the
little strangers.  Indeed, the wildness of the sheep,
and the few goats, and the exceeding tameness of the
coneys and gulls, were proofs that the island was
seldom visited.
</p>

<p>
For the time being our little heroes were undoubtedly
monarchs of all they surveyed.
</p>

<p>
Dinner, however, was the first thing to be thought
about.  That discussed, the boys left Toddie and Tip
to clear up while they started work.
</p>

<p>
"The first thing, Friday," said Crusoe, "is to build a
fire on the hillock.  There is a lot of brushwood, so
come on."
</p>

<p>
They gathered plenty of stuff, and heaped it up, all
ready to light after nightfall, or rather in the gloaming;
for the nights were now short, and unless boats were
actually sent out to look for them there would be
small chance of the fire attracting much attention.
And smoke seen during the day by any passing ship or
vessel would only be considered the work of some
shepherd or tourist.
</p>

<p>
There was more wood down in the little bay that
they had explored, but a fire there would not be easily
seen; besides, even if seen, sailors or fishermen would
put it down to kelp-making.
</p>

<p>
There was quite a wealth of wild flowers here also,
many that even Fred had never seen before, so they
culled great bouquets and, brought them back with
them to Toddie, who at once set about decorating the
yacht.  This work kept the child busy, and Tip too,
who took intense interest in all his little mistress did.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose, Friday," said Crusoe, "we inspect stores?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose, massa," said Friday, "we read a book
instead?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Friday boy.  No laziness.  Get up the stores
at once."
</p>

<p>
So Friday obeyed, and Crusoe carefully counted all
the eatables.
</p>

<p>
"We have enough to last us for over a week," was
Crusoe's summing up.
</p>

<p>
"Then we can fish."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, Friday, I hadn't thought of that!  Get the
lines out, and we may catch some for supper."
</p>

<p>
There was one thing they were rather short of,
namely, spirits for the stove; but they contrived a
regular gipsy-fire of wood, with stones so arranged that
they could place a saucepan over the glowing embers.
Toddie brought her picture-books down to the rocks,
and the boys began to fish.
</p>

<p>
Fishing is a dreamy kind of employment anyhow, so
it is no wonder the time flew fast away.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, isn't all this jolly!" said Friday, as he pulled in
his fifth grey mullet.  "Now, massa, how nice it would
be to stay here a month, if we could only catch a
seagull and send it home with a message."
</p>

<p>
"That would be glorious.  But see, Friday, the sun is
nearly down.  What lovely colours!"
</p>

<p>
"Now for supper," cried Frank
</p>

<p>
The fire was soon made, and the fish were roasted
as Indians cook their fish, by attaching them to a
sloping wood grating close to the dying embers.
</p>

<p>
"It is a supper worth being shipwrecked twenty
times for," remarked Fred.
</p>

<p>
This sentiment was agreed to by his friend, and
seconded by the little queen.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said her majesty, "Tip and I is twite full of
joy and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Grey mullet," said Fred, laughing.  "Come, Tod,
we're going to make this bonfire."
</p>

<p>
That was a blaze.  Surely it could be seen a hundred
miles away!  What fun they had too, chasing or racing
round the flames and through the smoke till Toddie
looked like a gipsy's bairn, and Frank was black enough
for any Friday.
</p>

<p>
Then they heaped more wood up with damp stuff to
keep it alight.
</p>

<p>
They washed themselves at the rill, dried their faces
with their handkerchiefs, then joined hands and went
singing back to the boat.
</p>

<p>
Frank read aloud from Robinson Crusoe for quite an
hour, then they said their prayers and turned in.
</p>

<p>
But on this night Fred and Frank slept under the
sails on the sand, so that they might hear if any boat
came, and Toddie and Tip had all the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"You won't feel lonely, will you, Tod?" said Fred
last thing.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Toddie, "I've dot Tippetty you know,
and I s'pose the Dood God isn't <i>vely</i> far away."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br><br>
"FRIENDS FOR LIFE"&mdash;ROUND THE CAMP FIRE.
</h3>

<p>
The next morning after breakfast Crusoe
and Friday set to work in earnest.  They
very soon fashioned rude spades, and the
tide being well back they commenced digging
around the yacht.  They dug and dug for
hours.  Then the Crusoe stood up to
straighten out the "kinks from his backbone," as he
himself phrased it.  He scratched his head and
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, massa," said Friday, "you look very wise."
</p>

<p>
"We're a pair of fools though, Friday.  Just listen,
we're not doing a bit of good, we're only sinking the
yacht lower, and as fast as we dig a canal down to the
sea, as fast will the waves fill it up with sand."
</p>

<p>
Friday cried, "Hurrah!  I am so glad!"  Then he
threw away his spade.  Friday was not fond of work.
You see, reader, theory is one thing, practice another.
</p>

<p>
They went away now to the hill again to rebuild
the fire.  It was quite out, and it was evident enough
no one had seen it, or taken much notice of it at all
events.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure, you know, that the fire will be of
much use," said Fred, "but it is the correct thing to do,
so we must do it for Toddie's sake.  You and I, Frank,
wouldn't mind this life for a month."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, for dear Toddie's sake, brother Fred."
</p>

<p>
There was something in the look that Frank gave
his companion, more than in the words themselves, that
went straight away to the heart of the fisher-boy, and
on the impulse of the moment he stretched out his
hand, and right heartily was it grasped.
</p>

<p>
"For life," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Fred, "friends for life, Frank."
</p>

<p>
And so the strange compact was sealed.
</p>

<p>
A compact such as this men may smile at, but there
is far more in the love that often exists 'twixt boy and
boy, than many old heads could imagine or would be
willing to believe.
</p>

<p>
As soon as dusk fell again the fire was once more
lit, and once more the children danced and played in
its rosy gleams, then, somewhat tired, though certainly
not weary, they went home to read and talk around the
camp fire, and then sleep again sealed the eyes of our
shipwrecked mariners.
</p>

<p>
Another day and another went by just the same.
The island seemed quite out of the course of steamboats,
and fisher-boats never came near it.
</p>

<p>
But all through the glad sunlit hours they played at
Crusoes, at pirates, and smugglers, and all sorts of
children's heroes, and the day did not seem half long
enough to contain all the jollity and joy that had to be
crammed into it.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure that the hour around the camp fire just
before turning in was not the jolliest of all, for on
board the little yacht they had all sorts of pleasant
story books, and while Frank or Fred read aloud, the
other two permitted their fancies to run riot in the
pleasant land of imagination.
</p>

<p>
But why, they often wondered, did no boat answer
their signal?  It was kept up now even in the sunshine.
It was as Fred reverently said, a pillar of cloud by
day, and a pillar of fire by night.
</p>

<p>
Yet nevertheless they seemed forgotten of all the
world.
</p>

<p>
But one evening, just at sunset, and before the night
fire was lit, to their joy they saw a boat coming straight
down under sail towards the island.  It came near
enough for them to see the fishermen's caps and faces.
</p>

<p>
They ran down to the cliff top, and the boys,
took off their coats, shouting loudly.
</p>

<p>
Yes, they are heard; for look! there is a commotion
in the boat, the sail shivers, the boat's way is all
but stopped.  Next minute, to the consternation of
the children, and to their astonishment as well,
round goes the mainsail boom, and away on another
tack flies the boat.
</p>

<p>
The truth is, this little island was supposed to be
haunted, and these superstitious fishermen, who had
probably come from a far-off island, believed they had
seen ghosts in daylight.  The forms of Toddie, Fred,
and Frank, on that dizzy cliff top, scaring the myriads
of wild birds with their waving garments, appeared to
their frightened imaginations as giants warning them
away from the place.
</p>

<p>
When the children lit their fire that evening, they
did not think of dancing round it, and hardly one of
them spoke as they went slowly down to the beach
again.  Even Tippetty was dull, and lagged behind.
</p>

<p>
"Don't lead a stoly to-night, Flank," said Toddie.
"I's so tired."
</p>

<p>
Then Fred took her on his knee and nursed her, and
she soon fell fast asleep.  Between the two of them
they carried her on board, and put her to bed with Tip.
</p>

<p>
The boys turned in as usual under the sail on the
sand; but about two o'clock, or half-past, just as the
dawn was creeping gray over the sea, Fred awoke, and
getting up went straight away to Toddie.
</p>

<p>
Tip looked up, and gave a little low coughing bark.
He was afraid to bark aloud lest he should wake his
charge.  But poor Toddie never opened her eyes.
Fred felt her hands and arms, which were tossing
uneasily about.  They were hot.  He put his cheek to
hers.  It was burning.
</p>

<p>
Then the terrible truth flashed over his mind,
Toddie was ill, and in a fever.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he moaned, "what if no help comes, and she
dies all alone on this island!"
</p>

<p>
He sat by her side now till seven o'clock.  She only
waked once and called for water.
</p>

<p>
She sat up in bed, but her eyes had a sparkle that
Fred did not like.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ill, Toddie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; I'se not ill, oo know.  Only dust feepy
(sleepy); but, Fled, I didn't say my players.  Will the
Dood God be angry?"
</p>

<p>
There was a big lump in Fred's throat, and he did
not dare to speak, only snuggled her up, and she slept
once more.
</p>

<p>
All that day she lay like a wee dying bird, and it
was indeed a long and a lonesome one to the boys.
No more Crusoe now, no more Man Friday.
</p>

<p>
When sunset came again they went to the hill and
lit the fire.  Tip would not come.  Like Toddie, he had
eaten nothing all day; the spirit seemed clean gone
out of him.
</p>

<p>
Neither Frank nor Fred could go to sleep to-night,
so they brought the lamp down to the cabin and sat on
the floor, whispering low when they talked at all, Fred
holding Toddie's hot wee hand.
</p>

<p>
It almost broke the boys' hearts to hear the poor
child raving in her delirium about her dolly-fish and
the Johnnie whale, and calling for Daddy Pop.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank!" said Fred at last, "Toddie's going to
die to-night, I feel so sure, so sure!"
</p>

<p>
Then his head dropped on his friend's shoulder, and
he fairly broke down and sobbed.
</p>

<p>
"Fred," said Frank, "you're generally the bravest of
the two"&mdash;Frank took no note of his grammar to-night,
poor lad&mdash;"but now I must take you in hand."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank! but you don't know how much I love
Toddie, no one can ever know; and if she dies, and I'm
sure she will, I don't want ever to do anything again."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Fred, she won't die.  Now don't be silly,
Fred."  Frank patted his friend, and soothed him as if
he had been a baby.  He really was a baby in heart at
present, for the dear boy had had no sleep for so long
a time, and sorrow weighs the eyelids down.
</p>

<p>
He was quiet at last, sobbed a little now and then,
opened his hands once or twice very wide, clutched his
right hand, and slept.
</p>

<p>
Then his friend lowered him gently to the deck,
placed a jacket under his head, and gradually drew
himself high enough up to watch Toddie.
</p>

<p>
Tip looked at him with his sad brown eyes.  "Somebody
has hurt my poor little mistress," he seemed to
say; "can't you help her?"
</p>

<p>
It looked as if nothing could ever help Toddie again.
Her breath came in gasps, and her eyes were only
partially closed.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly it occurred to Frank that he had in the
ship that little fever mixture his mother always made
him take a teaspoonful of when ill.  It was there in
the cupboard, and he got it at once.
</p>

<p>
Tippetty watched him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to make your little mistress well, Tip."
</p>

<p>
Tip wagged his tail just once, as if he were not too
sure about it.
</p>

<p>
Then Frank poured a little in a glass.
</p>

<p>
"Can you drink, dear?" he whispered, gently raising
her head and shoulders.
</p>

<p>
The child opened her eyes, smiled faintly, and drank.
</p>

<p>
Then he lowered her back on the pillow.
</p>

<p>
"Oo is a dood daddy whale," she muttered, and
closed her eyes in sleep once more.
</p>

<p>
A whole hour must have passed away&mdash;a long and
weary one for the watcher.  Frank had been holding
Toddie's hand all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Flank!  Flank!"
</p>

<p>
It was Toddie's voice, and she sat bolt upright on
the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Toddie, lie down, dear!"
</p>

<p>
"No, Flank, I's listenin'."
</p>

<p>
With her great glistening eyes, open to their widest
extent, she quite terrified the boy.
</p>

<p>
"They is toming, Flank, they is toming!  I's going
home, Flank.  Oh, I's going home!"
</p>

<p>
Frank was petrified with fear.  He had never seen
death, but something told him it must be like this.
"listen, Flank; listen!"
</p>

<p>
Frank did listen now.  Then he could distinctly
hear a shout.
</p>

<p>
"Fred, Fred!" he cried, forgetting even Toddie in his
excitement.  "A boat, Fred! a boat!  We're saved, and
Toddie will live."
</p>

<p>
"Of tourse," said Toddie, "I's doin' to live.  Listen
adain."
</p>

<p>
They could now hear the sound of oars in rowlocks,
and both the boys rushed overboard and down to the
water's-edge, just as a cobble was beached.
</p>

<p>
Bunko jumped plash into the water and quickly
drew the boat up, then Eean himself descended.
</p>

<p>
"My poor boys," he cried, "how you must have
suffered!  And Toddie, is she well?"
</p>

<p>
Fred would have spoken, but Frank grasped his arm.
"She is just a little feverish, sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Look! look! she is coming," he cried now, and
hurried back to the yacht.
</p>

<p>
Tippetty had jumped on to the sand, and Frank's
sturdy young arms were just extended in time to save
poor Toddie from falling after him.
</p>

<p>
Next minute she was at home in Daddy Pop's strong
arms.
</p>

<p>
Bunko was standing on the beach in the morning
dawn, leaning on his pole, and looking picturesque
enough in his red coat against the dark gray of the
rocks.
</p>

<p>
"It's no' very sodger-like to greet (cry)," he said,
hiding his eyes with his raised arms; "but&mdash;forgive
me, my friends, I canna really help it."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
A great red ball of a sun was rising through the
summer morning's haze, and throwing its crimson over
the sea as Eean's boat, the <i>Treasure-trove</i>, stole silently
away from the Crusoe isle, with both the cobble and
the yacht in tow.  Bunko was in the cobble with his
pole, and it took him all his time to prevent the two
crafts from colliding.
</p>

<p>
But a westerly wind sprang up, and by one o'clock
all were safe in Methlin Bay.
</p>

<p>
The children and their little yacht had long, long
been given up for lost; only somehow hope remained
in Eean's breast.  He had therefore cruised about for
nearly a week, and at last chanced to fall in with the
very boat our heroes had seen approaching the haunted
island.
</p>

<p>
They told him a strange and garbled story about
gigantic spirits having been seen dancing in smoke, and
Eean had at once come to the conclusion that the
giants might be the dear children he was in search for.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the arrival of the <i>Treasure-trove</i>
in the bay, poor wee Toddie was handed over to
Eppie's tender care, and Bunko was dispatched for the
doctor.  But nevertheless I feel quite sure it was
owing more to Mammy Mop's tender nursing than to
this doctor's physic, that Toddie at the end of two
weeks was enabled once again to join Fred and Frank
in their rambles.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say that Mrs. Fielding had been
half wild about her boy.  It is almost needless to add
that she spoke of depriving the boys of their yacht.
But Eean got her to listen to reason at last.
</p>

<p>
"It was all an accident," he argued.  "The lads
could not have behaved more heroically, or shown
themselves better sailors, and she ought to be proud of
her boy."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Mrs. Fielding," said Eean in conclusion, and
talking almost bitterly, "Frank would be a man if you
would only permit him to be so."
</p>

<p>
So, much to their joy, the boys were allowed to go
yachting and fishing again, and playing at pirates too,
and once more Tippetty took his old seat at the bows
where he could best bark at the sea gulls, and once
more Toddie bravely took the tiller.

CHAPTER XII.
<br><br>
THAT AWFUL NIGHT AT SEA&mdash;A RIDE FOR PRECIOUS LIFE.
</h3>

<p>
During this long summer holiday Fred made
quite a sailor of his friend Frank, that is as
far as anyone could, for the lad was not
entirely cut out for a seafarer.
</p>

<p>
In return for this instruction in seamanship
Frank taught Fred to ride, and riding was really an
accomplishment of Frank's.  It takes a plucky boy too
to acquire the art of horsemanship with a Shetland
pony, especially when, as Frank insisted, the learner
had first to practise bare-back.
</p>

<p>
"You'll never get the grip with your knees else," he
told him rightly enough; but this daft wee horse was
probably just as difficult to ride before you knew his
tricks and his manners as any to be met with in
all Scotland.
</p>

<p>
However, Fred was declared master after a time, and
then the pony became far more serious and manageable.
</p>

<p>
But this delightful holiday came to an end at last,
and once more Mrs. Fielding took her lad south to a
fresh school she had heard such good accounts of.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Frank!" said Eean, when he heard of it.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Some people would have condemned the fisherman
bard's plan of training Fred.  I myself do not think
it was wrong.  He was certainly kept strictly to school,
and his lessons were superintended by Eean himself at
night; but then he had unbounded exercise, and he
was also taught to work.  Before he was fourteen years
of age he was a fairly good carpenter, and could help
to make a cask, while he knew all the mysteries of fish-curing.
</p>

<p>
Then he had his hobbies, namely, his music and his
aquarium, and he had his amusements as well.  The
wild woods were his home, and on the sea he felt as
safe as in his own bed in the fisherman's cottage.
</p>

<p>
Fisher folks are a very humble and unambitious
people; but I really know no other class so innocent
in their mode of life and manners.  If Christianity
flourishes anywhere in Scotland, it is in the obscure
villages of honest fisher people.
</p>

<p>
Very superstitious they are, however; but surely
there is no harm in this.
</p>

<p>
Kindly they are too, and clannish, hardly caring to
mix much, far less intermarry, with the peasantry that
dwell around them, and when grief falls upon one
house it seems to fall on all.  A wedding causes happiness
and merriment to the whole of a fisher community,
and a death, especially by drowning, brings grief to
every cot.
</p>

<p>
Although Eppie was not by any means very old, she
was looked up to as the matron of the village&mdash;a
veritable mother in Israel.  She was supposed to know
far more of medicine than the old doctor who used to
put in an appearance about once a week riding on a
wonderful old white pony.  When I tell you what this
pony did one day, you will, I think, admit he was
entitled to be called "wonderful."
</p>

<p>
Frank, on his Shetland, overtook the old doctor
in a wood, and touching his hat to his grey hairs,
immediately commenced a conversation.
</p>

<p>
"That's been a nice pony of yours, sir, in its day."
</p>

<p>
"Humph!" said the medicine man, "I daresay you
think both he and I are out of the hunt, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, sir!  But I say, sir, this is a nice bit of
road, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
The doctor laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I do like a cheeky boy," he said; "but see if I
don't accept your challenge.  From the first milestone
to the next, then.
</p>

<p>
"Now here's the milestone; are you all ready?"
</p>

<p>
"All ready, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Gee&mdash;ee&mdash;up, then!"
</p>

<p>
And away they went.
</p>

<p>
For the first half mile Frank was far ahead.  So
confident of victory was he that he took off his bonnet
and waved it back at the doctor.
</p>

<p>
But before he was aware a streak of lightning seemed
to be coming up behind, and Frank had to fly.  Hand
over hand the doctor came on; it was soon neck and
neck; and after this poor Frank was nowhere in the
running.
</p>

<p>
But Eppie was an herbalist; no witch, however.
She did not gather her simples at midnight on the
moor under the light of the moon, nor utter incantations
over them.  No; she used to walk out in broad
daylight knitting her stocking, with Toddie and Tip
coming up behind her, each carrying a basket.
</p>

<p>
As she passed through the village on her return she
would call at many a little cot, and she had a welcome
wherever she went.  The old women would get up and
dust a chair for her, and the toddling bairnies would
run laughing to meet her.  And honest Eppie never
came away without getting a blessing, and leaving one
too.  She would leave something else as well for the
sick; namely, a bunch of roots or fresh green leaves,
with instructions how to brew a decoction therefrom.
</p>

<p>
"These reets [roots] are, may be, no vera bonnie,"
Eppie would say, "but they're the best things for the
bluid you ever saw or heard tell o'."
</p>

<p>
Eppie was as good as an elder among some of the
sick people, and she had a way with her of administering
spiritual advice that never gave offence.  How
prettily she could tell a Bible story, or describe in,
simple language the plan of salvation, those who
heard her speak in her own broad East of Scotland
Scotch&mdash;for she was not a native of this wild west
village&mdash;may remember to this day.
</p>

<p>
Eean never visited; he was naturally shy but he
conducted service in his cave every Sunday evening
all the year round.
</p>

<p>
On calm summer evenings boats containing stranger
tourists would sometimes stop beneath the cliffs, and
greatly would these holiday-keepers marvel to hear
the sweet sad strains of "Martyrdom" or "London
New," coming whence they could not tell, for no
one was visible on the cliff or about it, and the
ports of the cave were not easy to distinguish.
</p>

<p>
The village of Methlin was a very small one from a
fisherman's point of view; but though the boats were
few, they were manned by hearts as brave as ever
dared to face the stormy ocean.  Nor were the fishermen
idlers or laggards.  They did not depend on the
herring season for a living&mdash;they found fish all the year
round if it were possible to go out; then there were
always lobsters and crabs to be caught in the cage or
creel.  The haddocks were smoked, and cod were
salted.  There was a town about twenty miles from
the village, and here there was a ready market for all
the produce of this industrious people.  Instead of
loitering about the street corners on days when fishing
was an impossibility, the men found plenty to do in
their gardens, which were kept in great perfection, or
on their little crofts of an acre or two each in extent.
</p>

<p>
If ever a stray tourist or strolling artist came to
Methlin, he was at once struck by the beauty of the
gardens and the quaintness of the cottages.
</p>

<p>
On the whole I am rather proud of my wee village,
and do not hesitate to say it was unique, and of its
kind quite idylic.
</p>

<p>
Next to Eean and Eppie, I'm not quite sure that
honest Bunko did not rank as the greatest favourite
after the adventure I am now going to describe.
</p>

<p>
I should state, to begin with, that Scottish fishing
boats are not like those used, say, at Yarmouth and in
England generally; these latter are decked over, and
therefore fit to stop a week at sea; the Scotch are open
all amidships, and, though very strong and high in
the free-board, would quickly fill and perish in a
sea-way with a strong gale blowing.
</p>

<p>
But the hardy Scot, like the Viking of old, takes his
life in his hand, and boldly ventures far to sea in these
boats; yet, woe is me! never a season passes that
widows and children are not left to weep and mourn
for dear husbands and fathers they ne'er will see
again in this world beneath.
</p>

<p>
It was in the autumn time, when the corn in the
fields was ripening yellow, when the leaves on the
birchen trees were growing darker and darker, and
when almost every bird save the robin and skite
had ceased to sing, that there came a boat into Methlin
Bay reporting fish to be found in immense shoals a
goodly way to the nor'ard and west.  On board this
boat was a wealth of silvery herrings, amply proving
the truth of the boat-owner's words.  He had called
here to give the villagers a friendly hint.
</p>

<p>
What hurry, commotion, and excitement there were
now!  The men, women, and even the tiniest children
were busy for a time; but soon this passed away, and
there fell over the village that strange hush that only
the women of wigwams in the Indian districts of
America west, when their braves have gone on the
warpath, know, or the wives of Scottish fisher-folk,
when their husbands are hurried away to sea.
</p>

<p>
Eean had gone with the rest, and with him both
Fred and Toddie, for the latter would not be denied.
</p>

<p>
The weather was to all appearance most propitious for
deep-sea fishing, and everyone was cheerful and merry.
"Why, Toddie, you coming with us!" said Eean's best
hand.  "Why we'll have luck, my little lass!"
</p>

<p>
As Eean rolled his wee girl in a pea-jacket, and set
her near him at the helm, he could not help crooning
to himself some verses from Longfellow's "Wreck of
the <i>Hesperus</i>."
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "It was the schooner <i>Hesperus</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hat sailed the wintry sea;<br>
  And the skipper had taken his little daughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bear him company.<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her cheeks like the dawn of day,<br>
  And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ope in the month of May."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Away went the boats.  The women and children
watched them from the cliff-top till a gathering haze
swallowed them up, then went somewhat sadly back
to their homes.  "I dinna like the looks of the
weather," said a fisherman's wife that evening after
sunset.  "The moon has an unco' queer look about it,
and there are clouds rising in the east that'll soon
chase ilke starn [star] out o' the lift."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, Jemmie, hush!" said Eppie, heaping more
peat and wood on the fire.  "Our men have been
mercifully preserved on mony a stormy nicht, and I've
little fear of them noo, even should the wind blaw
ower the hills in hurricanes."
</p>

<p>
About ten o'clock that night Eppie was dosing in
her chair, for her day's work had been hard, when an
anxious knocking was heard at the door, and she
speedily got up and drew aside the bolt, admitting
three neighbours.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, woman, woman!" they cried, "hear at the wind,
and Johnnie Stevens' glass is doon, doon, doon!  It'll be
the wildest nicht at sea that ever a boat was oot in."
</p>

<p>
"Sit down by the fire," said Eppie.  "I've been
listenin' to the wind.  It's no a cheery sound; but oh,
women, do you no ken that the Lord can hold the sea
in the hollow of his han'?"
</p>

<p>
But I fear Eppie was trying to impart to her
neighbours a comfort she herself was very far indeed
from possessing.  No one thought of bed or rest that
night.  Nor could the wives who had gathered around
Eppie's blazing hearth sit long in one place.  They
must keep pacing about, often going anxiously to peer
out into the darkness, shuddering and shivering as
they heard the wild howl of the tempest and the rattle
of hail and sleet on the window panes.  The kindly-hearted
Eppie kept them talking as much as possible,
and she herself seemed no whit affected, though in
reality her heart was a heavy one indeed.  But there
were, in spite of all she could do, spells of silence,
broken only by the wail and "howther" of the wind,
and the sobs of those grief-stricken women.
</p>

<p>
It must have been well on towards morning when
every eye was turned towards the door, for the "sneck
was tirled"; and next moment the outer door was
opened.
</p>

<p>
Who was coming?
</p>

<p>
Every heart beat quick with anxiety.  Then the
inner door was thrown wide, and in stalked Bunko, red
coat on and pole in hand.
</p>

<p>
His bonnet was pulled down over his ears, and his
face was rain-battered and red.  He looked indeed an
uncouth figure.
</p>

<p>
"He is a good man," said Bunko, "and bringeth
good tidings."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, may the Lord love you for they words!" cried
one of the women; "but speak, Bunko, speak!"
</p>

<p>
"It's like this," said the half-witted lad.  "There is
hope yet, ye mustna let down your hearts.  I've just
come back from the harbour, and ae [one] boat has
just come in."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bless you, Bunko!  Who's boat is it?"
</p>

<p>
"None o' your men."
</p>

<p>
The women wrung their hands.
</p>

<p>
"It's Will Scroggie's boat.  Will had a mis-shanter,
and bore up afore the brunt o' the storm cam' on.  But
the boat is sadly tashed.  And a' the rest are blown
oot to sea."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Bunko, Bunko! is that a' the comfort ye have
to gie?"
</p>

<p>
"Wheesht, women.  Hold your din till I tell ye."
</p>

<p>
"When I returned sair for-fochten" (sorely
over-powered), "I found the public-hoose open, and in I
gaed to taste a drap for my stomach's sake.  And wha
saw I sittin' there by the fire but Sandie Grigg just
returned from the sea.  He'd heard the awfu' news,
and was condolin' wi' me about it, when up he sprang
frae his stool.  I have it, I have it," he cried.
</p>

<p>
"Hae ye ta'en leave o' your seven sinses?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Na, na, Bunko," said Sandie, "and if you can ride
you may save every boat."
</p>

<p>
"I can ride anywhaur, or do onything to save but
ane o' those bonnie boats," I cried.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he said, "it's twenty miles and a bittock
to the town of D&mdash;&mdash; whaur I came from the day.  The
gunboat <i>Sandpiper</i> is there.  She sails at seven sharp.
You may catch her.  Rin, Bunko, rin, and tell the
women folks, and I'll hae Jock Leggie's brown mare at
Eppie's door in a hand clap."
</p>

<p>
Even as Bunko spoke there came the sound of hoofs
on the stones outside.
</p>

<p>
"Quick, Eppie, quick!" cried Bunko, dashing his
plaid and pole on the floor, "give me a drink o' milk.
That's it.  Noo tak care o' Keelie.  Keelie, lie down,
sir, till I come back."
</p>

<p>
Eppie thrust a bannock in his pocket.  Bunko pulled
his cap down still farther over his brow, and hardly
waiting to hear the prayers and blessings the poor
women hurled after him, though he fain would have
waited, he pulled the door open and dashed out.
</p>

<p>
"You've three hours, but its deed against the storm
you'll ride."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do it or die," cried Bunko.
</p>

<p>
And away towards the woods he flew, hardly visible
in the hurricane mist that obscured the dawn of this
awful day.
</p>

<p>
He hurried on, but aye as the gusts gathered extra
force he waited for the lull, then once more struck his
heels against the sides of his willing steed.
</p>

<p>
Poor honest Bunko, he was Scotch to the back bone;
and as he tore along he kept up his courage with verses
from the Bible, and snatches from the poems of Burns.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, good mare!" he cried.  "It's life or death,
my lassie!  Clothe your neck wi' thunder, as Job says,
and rejoice in your strength.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "'But sich a nicht he took the road in<br>
  As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.<br>
  The wind blew as 'twould blawn its last,<br>
  The rattlin' hail roared on the blast.<br>
  Near and more near the thunders roll,<br>
  The lightnings flashed from pole to pole.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At long last he is near the town, in sight even of
the harbour.  He can even see the white steam and
the smoke of the <i>Sandpiper</i>.  Her commander was
one of those daring men whom no wind off a shore
would keep in harbour if he once made up his mind
to sail.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer comes Bunko; but, alas! the
mare's strength gives out, she staggers and falls.
Bunko is on his feet in a moment, and flying by
himself now towards the harbour steps.
</p>

<p>
The last boat has just returned.
</p>

<p>
The gunboat is already in motion.
</p>

<p>
But these boatmen knew not Bunko; and his red-coated
figure, bareheaded, and with face streaming with
blood, was startling enough, no doubt.
</p>

<p>
They positively refused to take him off.
</p>

<p>
"But," cried Bunko wildly, "it's to save precious
life, I tell you!  I'll give you one hundred pounds to
take me!"
</p>

<p>
"In you jump then, lad.  Shove off, men.  Give
way with a will.  We'll hardly catch her."
</p>

<p>
But Bunko tore off his red coat and waved it wildly
in the air, and next minute the good ship stopped.
</p>

<p>
The commander heard all Bunko had to say, and
loudly praised his gallantry.  "I'll save your friends,
boy, never fear, if they are still afloat."
</p>

<p>
So back to the shore Bunko was rowed.
</p>

<p>
The poor mare was on the top of the steps, but she
would need a long rest before she could take the road
again.  And Bunko himself felt the need of rest;
so, leading his mare, he betook himself to the
nearest inn.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Captain Heydon, of the saucy <i>Sandpiper</i>,
lost no time in steaming away in search of the missing
boats.
</p>

<p>
He came up with the distressed fleet about four in
the afternoon, and barely in time to save the lives of
those poor struggling fellows.  Not a boat had as yet
sunk, but they were filling fast; while the crews were
completely exhausted, and had given way entirely to
despair.
</p>

<p>
The faint cheer they gave, when they noticed the
brave little war-ship bearing down to their assistance,
could scarce be heard amid the howling of the storm.
</p>

<p>
Boat after boat was emptied of its crew, old Eean,
Toddie, and Fred being among the first to be hauled
over the side.
</p>

<p>
Weak as she was, Toddie resolutely refused to be
taken on board the gunboat, till she had seen her pet
Tippetty in safety.
</p>

<p>
The half-drowned men were at once seen to by the
kindly sailors, and were soon in warm hammocks or
sitting around the galley fire.
</p>

<p>
The boats as well as their crews were taken in
charge, but several were stove and sank; so that when
at last the <i>Sandpiper</i> steamed into Methlin port only
four remained afloat.
</p>

<p>
It was late when they got in, and the first intimation
of the safety of husband, brother, or sweetheart received
was from the men themselves.
</p>

<p>
But oh, what joy was there!  Some might have been
seen dancing, others laughing and weeping by turns,
while others knelt by their humble firesides and
prayed aloud.  It was an affecting scene.
</p>

<p>
But scenes like these, and many far more sad, are
to be witnessed only too often on the wild Scottish
coasts.
</p>

<p>
Concerning this very adventure, Thorn, the sweet
bard of Ury, writes in graphic language&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Man dies but once?  O, say it not!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lives again to die,<br>
  When the surly surly sea has taught<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hope-dissolving sigh,<br>
  When the stubborn arm, that strains for life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falls feebly on the oar;<br>
  When the loved last look of child and wife<br>
  Swims wildly o'er the settling strife,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Death, what canst thou more!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Just a closing word or two about the chief hero of
the episode, poor Bunko.  He did not return till next
morning, and it is needless to say the welcome he
received was a warm one.
</p>

<p>
He had taken plenty of time to ride back; but just
before mounting his mare, the boatmen who had rowed
him off came up to demand their fare.
</p>

<p>
One of them was rather rude.
</p>

<p>
"You're the village fool, arena' ye?"
</p>

<p>
"You're no over civil to say so, man," returned Bunko.
</p>

<p>
"Weel never min', we want that hundred pounds
ye promised us."
</p>

<p>
"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Bunko, turning to the landlord.
"They took a fool's word for a hunner poun's,
ha! ha! ha!  Wha's the fool now?"
</p>

<p>
Then he jumped into the saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Come ower to Methlin," he shouted as he cantered
out of the yard, "and you'll have a rattling good dram,
and be thankfu'.  Ta!  Ta!"
</p>

<p>
And with this promised hospitality in lieu of fare
the discomfited boatmen were fain to be content.

CHAPTER XIII.
<br><br>
"A STRANGE, STRANGE STORY," SAID FRANK. "I WONDER<br>
HOW IT WILL ALL END."
</h3>

<p>
The loss of nets and boats had been a severe
blow to the honest folks of Methlin.
</p>

<p>
Gladly would Eean have made good his
neighbours' losses; but, alas! he was poor.
Sitting in his cave one evening, however,
composing a poem on the recent disaster for
a well-known American magazine that knew the fisherman
bard's worth, he was looking around him at his
picture-hung walls.
</p>

<p>
"Why not," he thought, "dispose of a few of these,
and head a subscription with the funds thus raised?"
</p>

<p>
It was an intention that did him infinite credit,
for he dearly loved those strange scenes; they were
in reality the painted history of his life.
</p>

<p>
"Well, go they must," he said.  "It is in a good cause."
</p>

<p>
As he was placing five of them on his table he
heard footsteps on the stone stairs, and immediately
after the white-haired old doctor entered.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, poet," he said.  "Versifying, eh?
Well, there is five yellow boys towards a subscription
for boats and nets for your poor people.  If I were
rich I'd give you more.  No, I won't have thanks.
I'll run away if you begin.  But what are you
bundling up those quaint and curious pictures for?
Ah! good Eean, I see it in those shy eyes of yours.
Nay, nay, you cannot deceive a doctor.  But I tell
you what, you shan't make the sacrifice."
</p>

<p>
"I must, and will."
</p>

<p>
"You shan't.  Look here, I know a trick worth two
of that.  Have an exhibition of all the lot in Edinburgh.
There is a character about them, and when people
know it is for a good cause they will flock to it.
</p>

<p>
"Do it, man, do it," added the doctor emphatically.
</p>

<p>
And Eean took his advice.  The newspapers took the
affair up, and in a month Eean had raised nearly ¬£700.
</p>

<p>
Bonfires blazed on every hill on the night Eean,
the bard, brought back his pictures, and a huge
bonfire in the village square as well.
</p>

<p>
On the Sunday after, every man, woman, and
child marched in a body to the parish church
to return thanks to Heaven for all His mercies
sent them, the old minister preaching a special
sermon for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
Frank was there along with Fred, and so was
little Toddie and Tip.  Oh, yes, Tip went!  He refused
to stay at home.
</p>

<p>
But the most noticeable figure of all was Bunko
in a bran-new scarlet coat and Highland bonnet
with which the villagers had presented him.  Keelie
marched solemnly beside him, and lay at his feet in
the kirk till the blessing was said.  For remember
Keelie was a Scottish collie, and therefore knew what
was required of him on the Sabbath-day.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Nearly three years passed away.
</p>

<p>
This does not seem a long period of time to the
grown-up or the aged, so at the end of it there was
very little difference indeed in either Eppie or Eean;
but Toddie had stretched up, as the good people of
Methlin said.  She was nearly ten&mdash;quite old she
thought herself&mdash;and she had grown less round-faced,
more delicate in features, very much longer in the hair,
and had lost her pretty prattle, that is, she could talk
better English.  Oh, dear reader, I do assure you I
would rather have had her always the wee, droll,
lisping Toddie! but my heroine and my heroes will
shoot up and grow in spite of me.  There is Fred and
Frank for instance, fourteen or fifteen years of age
respectively, quite men almost.  Well, so they thought
anyhow.  And, without complimenting them in any
way, two sturdier, brisker, or bolder-looking lads you
would hardly meet in a long day's march.
</p>

<p>
"What do you think, Fred," said Frank one day,
"mamma wants me to be?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't guess," said Fred.  "Not a minister."
</p>

<p>
"Fred, don't be foolish.  I'm not good enough for that."
</p>

<p>
"I know you're not.  I was only joking.  Well, a
lawyer; but then you're hardly bad enough for that."
</p>

<p>
"Just what I told dear mamma.  She is so foolish
you know.  But I'm to be a barrister; so I suppose
I'll have to enter some old mildewed office in London,
with a red-faced, white-haired solicitor as my
slave-driver, and never see the sun shining except through
the cobwebs.  Then I'll have to work my way to the
bar; but oh, Fred, just imagine me with a flappy old
black gown and a stiff white wig on!  But I'm going
to another good school first, and then to Oxford, so a
lot of things may happen before I'm called to the bar.
Oh, I hate the very idea!"
</p>

<p>
Toddie was feeding her blennies in the aquarium
while this conversation went on, and the boys were
lying on the floor of the cave near by.
</p>

<p>
What a happy three years that had been though!
How many delightful sails they had had in the yacht,
musical evenings in the poet's cave, and tea with stories
to follow in the inside of their dear old Johnnie whale.
</p>

<p>
On this particular day, as soon as Toddie had fed her
dolly-fish, they all went together to spend the
afternoon in the igloo.
</p>

<p>
The little garden never looked more gay nor lovely,
the cosy wee room had never looked brighter or cosier,
and yet both Toddie and Fred were sad; for on the
morrow Fred was going far away to Glasgow, to spend
five months at a school previous to passing his
examinations as a midshipman in the merchant service.
</p>

<p>
He might have gone as an apprentice, but Eean
greatly loved the lad.  He had given him the education
of a gentleman, and wished to hurry him on; for after
all, in the race of life at sea, the middie has fewer
hurdles to leap than the apprentice.  And Eean well
knew what a sailor's life really meant, and how wild
and rough it was in the forecastle.  Tippetty wouldn't
keep out of his mistress's lap to-night.  He seemed to
know there was grief of some kind afloat in the air.
</p>

<p>
"You'll come often and see Toddie, won't you, Frank?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank," said Toddie innocently, "I can't live
if you don't."
</p>

<p>
Frank patted her hand, and as he did so Tippetty
took the opportunity of licking both their hands at one
and the same time.
</p>

<p>
Then Bunko came in to lay the tea, and by-and-by
Daddy Pop himself arrived, and Mammy Mop too, and
there were story telling and singing, so that the night
did not pass so sadly after all.
</p>

<p>
The tide was a long way back at nine o'clock, so they
all went home to Eean's cottage across the sands, and
there Frank stopped all the night.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Three months passed away and it was winter, a hard
and frosty one too; for weeks and weeks the ground
was like adamant, and the rocks were masses of crystal.
Peat became scarce in the village, and much driftwood
and logs of pine were burned.
</p>

<p>
The yuletide came round, and Fred came home for
a few days' holiday.
</p>

<p>
"We maun keep good fires on while you're here,"
said Bunko one day in the wood shed.  "Here's a log
noo," he said, "that'll mak' a fine lowe (blaze)."
</p>

<p>
It was a piece of a spar or ship's mast.  As he spoke
Bunko pulled it down and commenced to saw it
through the centre.  When half-way through the tool
struck on something hard, and Bunko took a big axe and
finished the work the saw had begun.
</p>

<p>
To his utter astonishment and that of Fred there rolled
out a handful of gold coins, and the head of a rusty axe.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Fred, "that is the log dear Toddie came
ashore on.  Daddy would never have it touched, but
he couldn't have known of the coins.  I'll run and
fetch him."
</p>

<p>
"Leave me, lads, for a few minutes," were the first
words old Eean spoke when he entered the shed.  Then
he sat down on the wood pile.  Scarcely could he have
stood just then had he tried.  His feelings were not
altogether those of excitement, though he was much
moved.  Something told him that the mystery of the
little waif Toddie was to be revealed to him.  The
gold that had fallen from the log he felt sure was but
a portion of the store therein, and he felt certain also
that he would find papers of some kind relating to the
child who had so woven herself round his heart, that
to tear her away would be an affliction he could not
survive.  He tried to pray&mdash;this was ever his solace
in life; but how hard it was just then to say from the
heart those words, "Thy will be done."
</p>

<p>
Now he nerves himself to action.
</p>

<p>
Why, he wonders as he proceeds to examine the log,
did he not think of doing so at the very first, when it
was washed in from the wreck supporting its little
burden, that but for his wife's skill in bringing back
the apparently-drowned to life would now be
slumbering in the quiet kirk-yard?
</p>

<p>
The axeheads in the old log had not only served as
a keel, he soon found, but also to keep in position a
piece of wood supporting a long belt of canvas.  It
was this latter Eean now hauled hastily forth, though
with trembling hands.  It was damp and decayed, and
the gold coins&mdash;Portuguese they were, he could see
at a glance&mdash;that rolled out lay unheeded on the
ground, while he quickly unfolded a piece of paper
that had lain among them.
</p>

<p>
It was written in Spanish, a language with which he
was well acquainted.  Before he began to read it a
strong wave of temptation passed through his mind,
but was bravely resisted.  "Why," whispered the
tempter, "not burn the letter before reading it?  It
could but tell the child's history, and he would have
in conscience and honour to give his darling up."
</p>

<p>
Eean had need of a strong will at that moment, the
will that in times of trial like this can boldly say,
"Get thee behind me, Satan."
</p>

<p>
He muttered a word or two of prayer once more,
then reseating himself on the wood proceeded to read
the document.
</p>

<p>
It was very much frayed, and the writing in part
obliterated.  Evidently it had been written during the
agony of the brief time between the striking of the ship
against the rocks, and her heeling back and sinking.
</p>

<p>
All the portion that has connection with our story
may be briefly told.  The vessel was the <i>Santa Maria</i>,
homeward bound from the West Indies.  The mother
of the child had died, and been buried at sea.  The
crew had mutinied, partially robbed the ship, and left
in boats, all but a devoted few.  Hence the mismanagement
and the running on a lee-shore.  The child's only
living relative was or "would soon be"&mdash;so ran this
strange epistle, written in the hour of death&mdash;"her
uncle&mdash;&mdash;" only decipherable word.
</p>

<p>
"If&mdash;&mdash;" here was a blank, "is spared by the waves,
may heaven be good to those who are good,&mdash;&mdash;" a
blank again, and the letter went but little further, only
a word here and there being readable, these were,
"uncle&mdash;&mdash;villain&mdash;&mdash;malediction&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
The signature itself was frayed out, no letters of it
remaining except four, "<i>PINT</i>."
</p>

<p>
The gold in all, which for the time being Eean left
lying where it was, hardly amounted, as far as he could
judge, to ¬£150 sterling.
</p>

<p>
"Gold!" he said, actually spurning it with his foot.
"What is gold to the love and companionship of my
little girl?  My own now, it is evident."
</p>

<p>
Then he shuddered as he thought how nearly he had
yielded to temptation, and done that which would have
made him miserable for life.
</p>

<p>
His wife and he had a long talk that evening over
the fire, and next day the fisherman bard started for
Edinburgh.  It was evident to all the villagers&mdash;from
whom he kept nothing back&mdash;that he was going to
consult his advocate, and the look of contentment on
his face when he returned two days later showed
plainly enough that his interview had been of the
most successful character.
</p>

<p>
Nor had he returned alone, and Toddie and Tip were
both wild with joy when, from the spring-cart that had
brought them all the way from the nearest big town,
not only the poet himself, but the two boys descended.
Eean had met Frank by accident in Edinburgh.  It
was getting near Christmas-time, so the lad was as
usual on holiday.  Both ran through to Glasgow to see
Fred, and at Frank's intercession he was permitted to
accompany daddy and his friend back to Methlin.
</p>

<p>
The group around the fisherman bard's fire that
night was an interesting one.  Just as on that summer's
evening long ago when Frank had first entered this
humble cot, Eean sat in his tall chair, Eppie was there
at the everlasting wheel, Toddie, Fred, and Frank, and
even Bunko, were here too, while side by side on the earth
lay Bunko's dog Keelie and honest little Tippetty.
</p>

<p>
Bunko replenished the fire with peats and wood, till
the little oil-lamp that hung in the corner seemed
sadly superfluous; the bright red gleams lit up the
cosy old-world room, made every face seem doubly
happy, and were reflected even from the dark,
smoke-varnished rafters overhead.
</p>

<p>
To-night Eean told Toddie's story all over again,
much to Frank's delight.
</p>

<p>
Toddie herself took an interest in it now, and that
is what she had never, never done before.
</p>

<p>
"Weel," said Bunko, "you're a good man, Mr. Arundel,
and I'll niver but believe it was an angel o'
the Lord that put the saw in my hand, and made me
cut up Toddie's log."
</p>

<p>
Frank had taken Toddie's hand as Bunko spoke, and
he still retained it as he said, "But what a strange,
mysterious story!  It is just like what we read of in
books.  And, Toddie, there is no saying what you may
turn out to be, you know, when the mystery gets all
cleared up.  Perhaps some Spanish princess, and a
chariot and six white horses, all caparisoned with blue
and gold, may come some day to take you off."
</p>

<p>
Toddie drew away her hand, and nestled her head
against her Daddy Pop.
</p>

<p>
"I would not leave you, daddy," she said, "if they
did come."
</p>

<p>
"What would you do, then?" said Frank, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, send Bunko away instead!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyhow," said Frank, after gazing thoughtfully
at the fire a few moments, "it is a strange
strange story.  I wonder how it will all end."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br><br>
"DUTY, LAD, DUTY.  STICK TO IT THROUGH THICK AND THIN."
</h3>

<p>
This is a world of changes.  There is nothing
certain in it save death itself.  Yes, it is a
world of changes, and the sooner in youth
one finds this out the better.  The richest
and the greatest men on earth would be fools
were they to say to themselves, "Here we
stand, and we shall never be moved."  For all things
pass away, and very often those we value the most
are the first to vanish.
</p>

<p>
No one could have wished to see a happier, more
hopeful face than that of Frank Fielding, as he
turned about for the seventh or eighth time to wave
an adieu to Fred and Toddie, standing yonder at the
door of the old-fashioned whitewashed cottage.
</p>

<p>
Frank was going home to spend his Christmas at
Benshee House; and a right happy and merry Christmas
everyone connected with the house had determined
it should be.  Mr. Fielding himself, who had gone to
London on most important business, would be down in
time to partake of the festivities, so he had written.
Nor was he coming alone.  At least a dozen of his
own and Mrs. Fielding's friends would come with him
to spend the holy week, in a not over-holy way
perhaps.  So extra servants had been hired, and even
an extra cook, "a <i>chef</i>," he called himself; and all
throughout the parish, for a fortnight before this,
nothing had been talked about except the great doings
that were to take place at Benshee House.
</p>

<p>
The one and only drawback to Frank's happiness
was, that his friends Fred and Toddie would not, or
could not, be there.
</p>

<p>
This was no fault of Frank's, it may easily be
believed.  He had mentioned his wish to have them
with him to his mother.
</p>

<p>
For once in a way she was haughtily obstinate.
</p>

<p>
"I can't help saying, Frank, I am just a little
surprised at what you ask.  There are very many and
very weighty reasons why those poor children&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Frank stuck his fingers resolutely in his ears till
his mother ceased talking.
</p>

<p>
It was a rude thing to do; perhaps it was even
unkind; but&mdash;well, he really could not help it.
</p>

<p>
He solaced himself, however, with the thought that
nothing should prevent him riding over on his pony
and spending an evening with them, as soon as he
could leave his aristocratic friends at Benshee House.
</p>

<p>
Now, except in large towns, Christmas is not a day
of great rejoicing in Scotland.  But at the fisherman's
cottage it was always kept, though in a very quiet
way.  So while mistletoe and evergreen hung in the
halls of Benshee, and mirth and music were the order
of the evening, Eean, with his family and a few
humble guests, surrounded a table in the best room
of the little cot, spread with such a variety of good
things, and such a weight of good things as well, that
in the brief intervals of conversation it was positively
heard to creak and groan.
</p>

<p>
Nor were evergreens wanting as decorations; and
it had taken Fred and Toddie a whole day to put
these up after Bunko had brought them home with
him from the snowy woods.
</p>

<p>
Such a splendid fire burned in the grate too as
quite set cold at defiance, and crackled and roared so
pleasantly, that neither the wind which howled around
the chimney, nor the boom of breakers on the beach,
could be heard.
</p>

<p>
There was mirth in the kitchen as well as in the
best room.  Bunko was there in fine form, and many
of the humbler among the fisher folks, both old and
young.  And if Tippetty occupied a proud position
to-night on the parlour hearth-rug&mdash;one-half of him on
the footstool, the other half off&mdash;Keelie the collie was
not a whit less snug at the other end of the house,
and had quite as many bones and tit-bits placed at his
disposal.
</p>

<p>
But by ten o'clock quiet once more reigned in
Eean's cottage home, for guests had gone, and prayers
were being said.
</p>

<p>
Seldom a night passed throughout the year, that
the fisherman bard did not go out to have a look at
the weather and the sea just before turning in.  It
must have been fully half-past eleven on this Christmas
night when he opened the door and walked out into
the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Darkness did I say?  Well, dark enough it ought
to have been, for there were neither stars nor moon, and
while a wild east wind came roaring through the woods,
the clouds hung close above them.  But darkness, no.
He noticed as soon as he shut the door a strange glitter
on the white walls of the cottages, and on rounding
the corner of his own house perceived, to his astonishment
and consternation, that the whole of the eastern
sky was illuminated by gleams of flames, and that
banks of white rolling smoke obscured the sky.
</p>

<p>
His first thought was that the forest must be all on
fire, and that the conflagration was rolling towards
them.  But this was unlikely, for the trees were green,
snow-laden pines.
</p>

<p>
He was presently joined by Bunko, who was coming
towards the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir!" cried the half-witted lad, "it's on our
bended knees we should a' be this awfu' nicht.  The
day o' judgment's fast approachin', sir."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, Bunko.  But we must find out where
the fire is at once; for if it be in the woods we must
cut down trees to make a gap, else it will sweep our
village off the earth, Bunko."
</p>

<p>
Running in hurriedly for his plaid and crook, and to
tell Eppie what he intended to do, he presently
rejoined Bunko.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Bunko," he said, "you can guide us to the
top of Ben Maroo; a mile will take us there, and we
will then find out where the conflagration is."
</p>

<p>
The two were joined by at least half a dozen of the
neighbours, to say nothing of Keelie.
</p>

<p>
Keelie and Bunko went first, straight away into
the darkling forest, and straight away through it too,
for no better woodsman lived than Bunko, assisted
by his dog.
</p>

<p>
It was rough walking here; but when the little
party once more emerged from the shadow of the trees,
and commenced to ascend the mountain, it was rougher
still.
</p>

<p>
They struggled up the west side, and after a climb of
fully half an hour they found themselves nearly at the
top, then they crossed right round above a yawning
precipice to the east side.
</p>

<p>
All in a moment, as it were, they were confronted
with the full glare of the terrible conflagration.
</p>

<p>
Benshee House was sheeted in flames!
</p>

<p>
This ancient seat was one of those fine old mansions
still to be found in the less wild portions of the
Scottish Highlands.  Though I call it mansion, it really
was more of a castle than anything else.  It had been
the seat of many a lord and laird in by-gone feudal
times, and had more than once probably even stood a
siege, or at least red-handed war must have raged
on its ramparts and around its moats.
</p>

<p>
The largest portion, however, was unoccupied, a
modern-looking wing or two alone being retained as
the residence of the Fieldings.
</p>

<p>
The fire had doubtless broken out here, but by the
time Eean and his party reached the mountain brow,
this portion was already roofless and gutted, and the
flames had full possession of the main block itself.
</p>

<p>
Flames were issuing from every port and window
thereof, and the turrets and towers were but shapes in
the centre of gleaming tongues of fire and clouds of
rolling smoke.  Far over the woods to the westward
flew the sparks as thick as the flakes in a snow
shower.
</p>

<p>
The burning of Benshee House will be remembered
by many who read these lines, as one of the grandest
but most awful sights ever witnessed in the western
Highlands.
</p>

<p>
Eean and his neighbours stood for hours on that
bleak hill-top, regardless of the bitter wind that raged
around them.  Indeed they seemed spell-bound.
</p>

<p>
Then slowly home through the heather and the
forest they returned to their peaceful village by the
sea.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
But news of even sadder import spread through the
country within the next two or three days.
</p>

<p>
At the very last moment Mr. Fielding's friends had
to start from London without him.  He hoped, he said,
to return next day.
</p>

<p>
Alas! next day saw poor Fielding lying dead in his
town house.
</p>

<p>
On that very Christmas night, while his Scottish
home was being consumed by fire, he was closeted with
his solicitors.
</p>

<p>
A very great city commercial failure had taken
place the day before, and Fielding was a ruined man;
nay, it was even more than ordinary ruin, he was
poorer that dread night than some of the beggars who
shivered on the Thames embankment.
</p>

<p>
When his servant went to call him in the morning
he found that master had never been to bed.
</p>

<p>
Yonder he sat in the arm-chair near the fire,
apparently asleep.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing in the grate but cold white ashes,
and&mdash;&mdash;master would soon be ashes too.  He was dead
and stiff.
</p>

<p>
It is well to pass over the events that occurred
immediately after the burning of Benshee, and the death
of Fielding.  Some things are best not told.  But even
did I desire to describe the grief of poor Frank, and
that of his proud&mdash;all too proud&mdash;mother, words would
fail me.
</p>

<p>
Suffice it to say that both she and he must now
depend, for a time at all events, on the charity of
friends and relations.  And oh, charity is a cold, cold
thing at best, but doled out begrudgingly by the hands
of uncles, aunts, or cousins, it is colder and more
bitter than poison itself.
</p>

<p>
Financial ruin, death and fire, and all to happen
within forty-eight hours!  Am I not right in saying it
is a world of change and a world of grief?
</p>

<p>
One day in spring a sturdy boy, in dusty garments
and stick in hand, knocked at the door of the
fisherman's cottage.
</p>

<p>
It was Toddie herself who opened it.
</p>

<p>
The stranger was Frank, but so changed she hardly
knew him.
</p>

<p>
But she dragged him in, and seated him by the fire,
as in the dear old days, and sat down on a stool beside
him.
</p>

<p>
Tip, the dachshund, was rejoiced to see the boy again,
and made frantic efforts to jump on his knee.  But,
alas! he was far too long for that, so he had to content
himself with licking Frank's hand, then resting his
brown-tan cheek lovingly against it.
</p>

<p>
When Toddie saw this, something seemed to come
over her all at once, and she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Frank was doing his best to console her when Eppie
herself entered, and Frank rose to greet her.
</p>

<p>
She took both his hands in hers, and the tears rose
even to her honest eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My poor, dear laddie," she said, "sae wan and sae
woebegone.  But cheer up, cheer up!  Believe me,
Frank, it may be all for the best."
</p>

<p>
By-and-by Eean himself came in, and even Bunko,
and nobody that night had a thought for himself or
herself.  Every effort was made towards making Frank
feel happy and at home.  These efforts were not
unsuccessful.  Some natures are wonderfully resilient,
and Frank's was one of these.  He was a brave,
open-hearted boy; and although no one could have felt
much more keenly than he did his altered position in
life, and the amount of unhappiness his fate had brought
on him, still he was by no means inclined to let down
his heart, as anyone might have gathered from a
remark he made that evening.  Tip had knocked down
the boy's stick.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Tippie," said Frank, "be careful of that; it is
really all I have left me in the world."
</p>

<p>
Eean took occasion to add to this, "Nay, boy, you
have hope, and you have youth, and you have health.
Glorious possessions all; and if you trust to our
Father, lad, He'll be a stronger rod and staff to you
than that stick, sturdy and all though it be."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well," said Frank, "I shan't need a stick long,
for I've made up my mind to go to sea."
</p>

<p>
"What!" cried Toddie, "and be a midshipman like
Fred?  How nice!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that would be nice, Toddie; but, heigho! if
I go at all it must be before the mast, or as an
apprentice.  Oh, Mr. Arundel," he added, colouring
slightly, "even if I could afford the outfit of a midshipman
I couldn't pass the examinations!  I'm very
stupid; but then&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Frank paused.
</p>

<p>
"What were you going to say?" said Eean quietly
</p>

<p>
"Well, I was going to say what I have no business
to say, because my dear mother always tried to do the
best she could for me; but, sir, the constant changing
of schools, and being allowed to do as I liked, and
to have as many holidays as I pleased, have&mdash;have
made a dunce of me.  I wish I'd gone to a Scotch
school like Fred."
</p>

<p>
"You're not a dunce, lad.  You haven't had
opportunities of learning, that is all."
</p>

<p>
"Heigho!  I fear I'm spoiled and idle; but I'm
going to try my very best to learn and to do well."
</p>

<p>
"Bravo, boy!" cried Eean, "give me your hand on
that.  Work hard, lad.  I've heard you talk before of
the dignity of labour.  Do your duty ever.  It is
because Britons&mdash;brave Scottish, English, and Irish
Britons&mdash;have done their duty all the world over, and
looked for a blessing from on high, that Great Britain
ranks this day as a first power, if not the first power,
among the nations.  Duty, lad, duty.  It is a sacred
thing.  Stick to it through thick and thin, and every
good will follow; and even if death should come in
the doing of it, your last thoughts will be thoughts of
peace."

CHAPTER XV.
<br><br>
THE GOOD SHIP "SAN SALVADOR."&mdash;A MYSTERY OF THE<br>
SOUTHERN SEAS.
</h3>

<p>
It was just such a night as a sailor
loves&mdash;bright and starry, with a ten-knot breeze
blowing, and enough sea on to heel the ship
over to leeward, and make one feel one really
is afloat on the ocean wave; a night to make
one feel rather proud of his ship too than otherwise, if
there really is any go and independence about her; a
night on which the seaman is apt to pause in his walk
fore and aft the decks, and gaze over the bulwarks at the
lapping, leaping, bubbling waters, that lisp to him, whisper
to him, sing to him, talk to him, and tell him of home.
</p>

<p>
If he is leaning over the lee side on a night like
this with the wind abeam, the water seems ever
so much darker and nearer, and the wavelets make
pretence every minute to jump up and kiss the hand
he extends towards them.  If he is leaning over the
weather side, the water appears brighter but far off,
for it catches the glints of the starlight and the
reflected shimmer from the long, clear line of
wave-scoured copper, ever and anon showing up as the
vessel swings to leeward.
</p>

<p>
The stars were as bright to-night as bright could be,
and the southern cross was very high in the heavens,
for the good ship <i>San Salvador</i> was well to the
south'ard.  She was ploughing her way across that wide
and lonesome sea, that stretches from stormy Cape
Horn far down in the fifties, to the Cape of Good Hope
in warmer latitudes, but pointing to an ocean that is at
times hardly less wild and tempest-vexed than that
which laves the shores of Tierra del Fuego itself.
</p>

<p>
A single glance at a map, reader, will give you some
idea of the width of this wondrous sea&mdash;five thousand
miles if it be a league; but think of its loneliness.
Almost entirely out of the track of ships was the
course of the <i>San Salvador</i>, for here is no great ocean
highway, so on, on, on over the deep and blue-black
waters the good barque had been sailing for weeks,
since the day she had rounded the Horn in a gale of
wind, with ice on every hand.  Sometimes the breeze
had been favourable enough, at other times dead ahead,
so that it was tack and tack all day long; but for days
she had lain becalmed&mdash;no, not lain, for she had come
into a strong current, and been drifted far to the south
out of her course.
</p>

<p>
They were trying hard now to make up that lee-way,
and only this very forenoon they had sighted
land, which, as nearly as they could make out, must
have been the lonely isle of South Georgia.  Never a
ship had they seen, never a sail or even canoe.  On an
ocean like this, and under such circumstances, one
cannot help feeling at times as if the world were all
a world of waters, and that the ship on which one
stands bears the only life afloat on it, and that it is
doomed to sail for ever and for ever onwards, yet
never reach a port or haven.
</p>

<p>
Seldom had they seen birds even, only now and then
a solitary albatross&mdash;great eagle of the sea&mdash;that flew
silently over them, nor deigned to turn an eye towards
the ship, or the frigate-bird that flitted past like some
dark spirit of the ocean wave.
</p>

<p>
No wonder that such a sea as this is supposed by
old hands to be haunted.  Not by phantom ships nor by
Flying Dutchmen.  Oh, no!  Vanderdecken was never
so low down in the world's great chart; but by strange
creatures, dark and fearful, that raise their awful forms
high out of the water to stare at you with wondering
eyes as your ship sails slowly by.
</p>

<p>
There is always much that is mysterious about the
ocean, much that we cannot understand, and creatures
may exist therein that are more dreadful to behold
than the wildest nightmares.  It is on still, calm nights
that these mysteries come up from the dark depths, so
sailors will tell you.  Even on the blackest nights they
may give some indication of their presence.  On this
very cruise of the <i>San Salvador</i>, for instance, the men
forward openly averred that the ship was followed,
was "shadowed," they termed it, by some dread
thing&mdash;they could not have told you what, for it had so many
shapes.  It was never twice seen alike.  But they
would have told you they always seemed to feel its
presence, and knew that it was not far off even in
daylight and in the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
In a fog, soon after they had got clear of the southern
ice, men forward heard a fearful blowing, hissing sound
on the lee bow, and soon after saw IT looming high
above them almost like a black cloud.  Then a plash
in the water and IT was gone.
</p>

<p>
In the broad light of day once a flag had been
dropped overboard.  Now, it is unlucky to lose a flag,
so the main-yard was hauled aback, and a whaler
lowered, manned by five men.  They could see the
flag spread out on the water after they had rowed
fully half a mile from the ship's position.  They pulled
fast and hard now, and soon reached it.  Horror of
horrors! the awful IT was near the flag, and no oar
was stretched out to recover the bunting.  What it
was like no man could rightly say; but all agreed as
to its being all legs and claws, with a beak-armed head
and terror-striking eyes.
</p>

<p>
Another day a boat went after a seal that was floating
on a morsel of ice.  When within about two hundred
yards of the little berg a very strange thing occurred.
A tall, black arm, higher and thicker than a fishing-boat's
mast, was slowly raised above the water, and there
remained, as if to warn them not to approach.  It is
needless to say the boat returned without the seal.
</p>

<p>
One dark night, a long, wriggling, snake-like line of
bluish fire was seen rushing along the surface of the
water.  All hands were called when it was no larger
than a ship's lantern far away on the lee bow.  All
hands watched it, getting bigger and bigger as it
approached.  All hands saw it cross the bows in the
shape I have mentioned, the men being frightened
almost to death, and clutching fearfully at each other,
none daring to speak or move, till finally IT disappeared
as it had come, far away on the weather horizon.
</p>

<p>
And every night, when becalmed, the men were
sensible of some huge dark image rolling in the water
at no very great distance.
</p>

<p>
Verily there are more things in heaven and in
the earth and sea, than we have dreamt of in our
philosophy.
</p>

<p>
But on this particular night the men of the good
barque <i>San Salvador</i> were far more cheerful than usual,
for IT had not not appeared in any shape or form for
several days.  Then the stars looked so comforting and
seemed so near, while away in the west lay a long
bank of rock-like clouds, the profile of which could be
seen every few seconds in the glare of the lightning
that flashed behind it.
</p>

<p>
There was not much light on deck, however, a
glimmer from the skylight, a smoking lantern forward
near the forecastle, and rays from the binnacle, but not
sufficient to show even the faces of three individuals
who were sitting on the grating abaft.  You could
have noticed that two were smoking cigars, the red
tips would have told you that, and the aroma of Cuba
confirmed it.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, if this wind holds, we'll go jumping across,
and get into Cape Town harbour in a fortnight's time."
</p>

<p>
"And if," answered the captain, for it was he whom the
mate had addressed, "<i>if</i> it doesn't blow more big guns,
<i>if</i> you don't lose the sticks out of her by cracking on
too much, and <i>if&mdash;if</i>&mdash;oh! there's lots of other <i>ifs</i>."
</p>

<p>
"If, for instance," said a younger voice to leeward of
the captain, "IT doesn't appear again and scare the
men to death."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Fred Arundel, are you there, lad?  I didn't
notice you, as you're not smoking.  But no, I think
we've left IT down to the south.  Though you're not
superstitious, are you, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"N&mdash;&mdash;no; that is, not much, you know, only I had
a queer dream last night."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! a dreamer of dreams are you?  Well, tell us
your dream.  It's just a night for a song or a story."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know, sir, I don't believe in dreams as
a rule, they are generally so silly and upside-down-like.
But this one was so vivid that I feel quite certain poor
Frank is either dead and gone, or I shall soon see him
again alive and well."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me, Fred, that the dream reads in
either direction.  But who is Frank?  You haven't
told us that yet."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I?  I feel somehow as if everybody should
know Frank.  But Frank is&mdash;a&mdash;well, Frank is&mdash;Frank,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure.  I don't doubt you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, excuse me, sir, for being so very stupid!  Well,
Frank Fielding <i>is</i>, or, heigho! <i>was</i>, my dearest friend
on earth, we loved each other so; and when we were
shipwrecked on a lonely island together we shook hands,
and vowed we'd be brothers till death.  And&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait a bit, Fred.  I'm taken all aback like.  Is
this part of the dream?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, this is all reality."
</p>

<p>
"But you weren't at sea before to get shipwrecked?"
</p>

<p>
Fred was saucily laughing now.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, sir, we were!  Our craft was the good ship
<i>Water Baby</i>, the owner, Frank Fielding, of Benshee
House.  I was captain, and the crew all told was my
sister Toddie&mdash;who isn't my sister at all,
however&mdash;and her little dog Tip."
</p>

<p>
"I begin to see through the milestone now," said
Captain Cawdor.  "Go on with your cruise of the
<i>Water Baby</i> then."
</p>

<p>
"There's nothing much to tell, you know.  We had
put to sea well-provisioned, and all that, and were
enjoying ourselves finely.  We had just finished dinner,
when a white squall came roaring over the mountains,
and blew us far away to the west.  I was the pirate of
the wild west seas, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"I say, mate, did you know we had a real live pirate
on board?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, it's terrible!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," continued Fred, "we were shipwrecked
on a desert island, and played at Crusoes, till Toddie
grew sick, and lay down to die.  Then it was very
awful; but somehow Daddy Pop found us, and we
were saved."
</p>

<p>
"Go on, lad."
</p>

<p>
"Frank's people were very rich, you know; but as
far as education went Frank, poor fellow, didn't know
much.  He was going to be a barrister, he told me,
and confessed at the same time he hadn't cleverness
enough to be a bar tender even, or a billiard marker.
Then his father died on a Christmas night, and Benshee
House was burned down&mdash;and my poor friend Frank
was ruined.  Daddy would have got him on as middie
like myself, but he was too proud to accept a money
favour, and he couldn't have passed the exams, either.
But he went to sea, and I greatly fear he has gone
before the mast.  Oh, fancy, sir, a gentleman's son, and
he himself a gentleman, working as a boy, scraping
masts, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Scraping fiddlesticks," cried honest old Cawdor.
"Why, lad alive, I begun life just like that, and look
at me now."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fred, "I am looking, but I can only
see the point of your old cigar."
</p>

<p>
"You young rascal, you!"  The captain gave Fred a
kindly slap.  "Do you feel me then?  But heave round
with that yarn of yours.  Didn't your friend write?"
</p>

<p>
"Just once to Toddie from Demerara, but he gave
no address, and didn't even tell her the name of his
ship.  Well now, sir, he and I have both been at sea
for nearly four years," continued Fred.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, boy, it's going on that way."
</p>

<p>
"I've been twice home, and I've passed for mate,
though Frank has made no sign.  But now in my
dream I saw him as plainly as I see you."
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
"I don't mean that, because I can't see you, but I
saw Frank Fielding coming smiling towards me and
holding out his hand."
</p>

<p>
"How did he look?"
</p>

<p>
"He looked well-dressed, healthy and bonnie, and a
sailor all over, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And you love this lad, Fred?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! sir, he is the only friend I have about my
own age.  I love him <i>like a brother</i>."
</p>

<p>
Captain Cawdor smoked in silence for a time.  Then
he put his iron hand once more on Fred's shoulder, but
this time he let it rest there for a time.
</p>

<p>
"Now, lad, I'll tell you what it is.  Ever since
you've come to me you've behaved like a brick, and a
brave brick too.  I've been watching all your doings,
boy; I hope I've been a father to you."
</p>

<p>
Fred patted the big hand that lay on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, indeed you have, Captain Cawdor."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've done your duty, what man or boy
can do more?  Then, when in half a gale of wind our
poor second mate Finch fell overboard, not a month
ago, you stripped jacket and boots and dived after him,
and you kept him afloat till we found you both.  Had
that mate of mine not been so fond of accursed rum
he'd be living now.  But his constitution was rotten
to the core&mdash;rum-rotten.  So his immersion killed him,
and I've made you second mate of the <i>San Salvador</i>.
And as sure as my name is James Cawdor, when we
get back to old England you shall have the Albert
medal for bravery in saving life at sea.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, sir, thanks, but it was really nothing."
</p>

<p>
"Stop, let me finish.  We are an officer short now,
and if we do meet that friend Frank of yours, and he
is worth an old ship biscuit, and up to the ropes, I'll
give him a chance, just see if I don't.  Don't thank
me, I hate verbal thanks.  Don't speak your thanks,
<i>live</i> it."
</p>

<p>
"I'll <i>live</i> to please you, sir.  Yes, I'll <i>live</i> my thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Well now, let us go below, and leave the mate to
keep his watch.  I want to hear you play a bit, I
always think it cheers the men forward up to hear
music aft.  Down you go first."
</p>

<p>
Fred dived below and entered the well-lighted little
saloon of the barque.  Though not large, it was as
snug and cosy as a lady's boudoir, and at the farther
end of it stood an open piano.
</p>

<p>
And now that the light shines full in their faces, we
can see both Fred himself and his kindly Captain
Cawdor.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br><br>
DEAKIN AND CO. AND THE LOST BRIG "RESOLUTE."
</h3>

<p>
It had just gone one bell in the first watch, and
so was nearly time for the frugal supper,
partaken of every night in the saloon of the
<i>San Salvador</i>.  The fact is, breakfast was
served sharp at eight o'clock, dinner at one,
and a high tea at six.  The tea was really a kind of a
sea dinner in itself, for the meat and biscuits were
always put down, with soft tack (bread) if there was
any.  Therefore supper after this was a mere snack,
say a box of sardines with pickled onions and biscuits,
washed down with coffee or cocoa.
</p>

<p>
To-night the steward spread the banquet as soon as
the captain and Fred came down.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Cassia-bud?"
</p>

<p>
"I call him in one minute, sah."
</p>

<p>
What a mountain of a fellow this steward was!  As
black was he as the inside of an empty ink-jar when
the cork is in.  All black except two rows of white
teeth and the conjunctiva of his eyes.  These last,
however, had a tinge of yellow in them.  Quambo was
really a giant, only a very good-natured one.  But
once or twice in a fight on shore the man had shown
the kind of metal he was made of.  He was very fond
of Fred.  One day the latter had interfered in Zanzibar
to protect a poor little slave lass, that a fierce-looking
Arab had been brutally using.  The consequence was
that the lad was mobbed.  But from the window of
the hotel Quambo had seen it all.  Downstairs he
rushed, and before he left the house with one terrible
wrench he tore an iron bar from the window, then
sallied forth.  Fred was lying helpless and bleeding,
and the Arabs and half-castes around him must have
numbered fifty at least.
</p>

<p>
"Clear the way!" cried Quambo.  "Sameela!
Sameela!" (Make room! make room!)
</p>

<p>
Then the fiends turned fiercely on the negro.  But
Quambo's eyes were flashing fire, and his nostrils
distended like those of a war-horse that scents the
battle from afar.  He mowed that ruffianly mob down
right and left, drawn swords were shivered in pieces,
and the thick turbans of the Arabs were no protection
against the terrible weapon that Quambo wielded.
He speedily rescued Fred, and bore him away in
triumph.  Fred and his friend the negro left the hotel
half an hour after, but no one wanted to renew the
combat.
</p>

<p>
Now Cassia-bud was also a negro, a poor, wee
innocent mite of a fellow, and the ship's pet.  Small
enough was Cassia-bud to ride on the captain's great
honest black Newfoundland dog, and small enough too
for the men to make a ball of and play a kind of game
with of a summer's evening.
</p>

<p>
"Kashie!  Kashie!" shouted Quambo, and next
minute Kashie appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Here, boy, pull my boots off!"  The captain had
flung himself into his easy chair and stuck out his
legs.
</p>

<p>
What a good-natured, aye, and good-looking, man was
this same skipper, as he liked to call himself!  For
well-nigh fifty years he had kicked about all over the
world; but, barring his grey hairs and snow-white
whiskers, you scarce could have told he was a day past
forty.  He was a thorough sailor every inch.
</p>

<p>
But is that our little Fred that used to be?  That
tall, handsome young fellow of seventeen, with dark
blue eyes, a wealth of brown curly hair, and a budding
black moustache.  Verily, it is none other.  Look at
his rosy face and pearly teeth.  Behold what the sea
and a virtuous life has done for the young Scottish
sailor!
</p>

<p>
Down he sat beside his captain, and the rapid
disappearance of those sardines and onions, with the crisp
toasted and buttered biscuit, would have made a
cockney stare in wonder.
</p>

<p>
Fred swallowed his cocoa.  Quambo mixed the
captain's last cup.  Cassia-bud put his master's
slippers on, and then lay down beside Hurricane Bob,
the Newfoundland, and took his fore-paws round his
neck; then Fred began to play and sing.
</p>

<p>
Fred had a sweet voice, and so modulated his
accompaniment that there was nothing but fascinating
unison from beginning to end of the song he sung.
</p>

<p>
The captain was right, the music really was infectious,
and had you come on deck half an hour after Fred
began to play, and strolled forward to the galley, a
happier lot of sailors than that around the fire it
would have been impossible to have imagined.
Spinning yarns and singing songs to the music of the
cook's old fiddle had become the order of the evening,
and even IT&mdash;the mysterious IT, which had followed the
ship so far&mdash;was forgotten in the general gaiety that
prevailed, and in the harmony that reigned universal.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Like Fred himself, and a large proportion of the
crew, Captain Cawdor was Scotch, and, like many
Scottish skippers, he was part owner of the barque
he commanded.  This was good for himself, but it was
also good for the other owners, none of whom were
sailors.  But they knew the ship was in excellent
hands, and that while they were sleeping quietly in
their comfortable beds, Captain Cawdor was sailing
the seas here and there throughout the world, taking
"a voyage," as he termed employment, wherever he
got it, and thus oftentimes managing to pay himself
and brother shipowners cent. per cent.  Then the
vessel was heavily insured, and were she even to
leave her bones on some foreign strand, the insurance
office alone would have to mourn, and they could well
afford to pay.
</p>

<p>
Cawdor had neither kith nor kin belonging to him,
all were dead and gone.
</p>

<p>
"I'm getting up in years," he told Fred more than
once; "but so long as I remain at sea I feel a young
man, and, please the Lord, Fred, I'll die on the ocean,
and be buried as a sailor should be."
</p>

<p>
On this voyage the <i>San Salvador</i> was on her way
from Valparaiso with a mixed cargo for the Cape, and
with much specie as well.  The men knew there was
gold and silver on board, and that the boxes lay in the
captain's cabin, and yet neither he nor his mate had
the slightest fear, so well chosen were the seamen.
</p>

<p>
There were, it is true, a few half-caste Spaniards on
board; but however much mischief they might have
liked to have worked, they were in too small a minority
to count for anything.
</p>

<p>
And so, despite the evil-augured IT that had dodged
around them, the ship sailed on and on over that
lonesome waste of waters, and no evil befel her.
</p>

<p>
At long last&mdash;glorious sight to those sea-weary
mariners&mdash;Cape pigeons came flying about, and pieces
of dark drifting seaweed; and then gulls appeared
to greet them; and then the mountains of Cape
Colony appeared, like a cloud in the nor'-eastern
horizon.  The men hailed them with three cheers.
</p>

<p>
The ship would lie for a whole fortnight at Cape
Town, and they all expected letters from home;
besides, Captain Cawdor was by no means niggardly in
the matter of leave; so the hands expected a good
spell on shore, and plenty of fun and dancing.
</p>

<p>
It was Fred's second visit to the Cape, but it had
been winter when he was here before; that is, it was
in the middle of June.  This is really a pleasant time,
for no snow lies in these regions, and indeed I have
never seen it fall.  The air, however, is cool and bracing,
and there are clouds to temper the sunshine, while
morning and evening sunrises are lovely in the extreme.
</p>

<p>
Now it was summer in these latitudes, and the sun,
though tempered by ocean breezes, was almost fiercely
hot; the sea was blue, and the sky was almost cloudless;
while the great and glorious mountains seemed
to simmer in the quivering naze.
</p>

<p>
All the first day of the ship's arrival Fred had to
stick fast on board, for both the mate and Captain
Cawdor were busy on shore, and cargo and specie both
were being landed.
</p>

<p>
In the evening when he returned the captain brought
letters from home for the ship's crew, and there were
several for Fred.  As soon as possible he hurried
below and lit his cabin swing-candle, and, sitting down
prepared to devour them.  There was a very long
letter from Daddy Pop, and one from Mammy Mop
as well.  Both contained much kindly and good advice.
Then there was a long, delightful letter from Toddie.
Poor Toddie was in grief, for not only was poor old Tip
dead, but Bunko's Keelie too; for though dogs love
us much, they cannot live for ever.
</p>

<p>
These letters were all loving and homely.  As he
read them the tears came welling into the lad's eyes,
as the humble little fisher cottage rose up before
him, the little whitewashed village among the green,
drooping silver birch trees.  He seemed to sit once
more, as he used to do, in that charmed circle by the
low hearth, with Eean in his arm-chair, Toddie on her
low stool, and Eppie at the spinning-wheel.  He
thought he could hear the crackle of the blazing logs
and the birr&mdash;rr&mdash;rr of the wheel, and see the firelight
flicker on the old bard's face and glance upon the dark
rafters, from which the brown hams hung, and the
homely strings of onions.
</p>

<p>
He sighed, and I'm not sure a tear did not fall.
He would have given a good deal just then to be able
to visit but for one half hour the little cottage by the
sea.  He put the letters away in his desk, and walked
on deck.  Strange as it may appear, he believed so
thoroughly in his vivid dream that he had really
expected a letter from his friend Frank Fielding.
</p>

<p>
The captain took him on shore with him next day,
and as they walked along the principal streets, Fred
would not have been a bit surprised to have met
Frank, just as he had met him in his dream.
</p>

<p>
The captain and he dined together well and heartily
at one of the best hotels, and were sitting talking
together over the dessert, when a tall, white-haired
gentleman drew near to the table.
</p>

<p>
"I beg pardon, stranger," he said, "but are you
Captain Chowder?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm Skipper <i>Cawdor</i>, of the barque <i>San Salvador</i>."
</p>

<p>
"The very individual.  I thought it was Chowder.
Well, Captain Chaw&mdash;Chow&mdash;I mean Cawdor, are you
open to take a commission?"
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, sir.  Have a glass of port.  Your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Deakin, of Deakin and Co.  We're shipowners,
oil-merchants, anything."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm open to load up and go anywhere."
</p>

<p>
"When can you start?"
</p>

<p>
"In half an hour after the last bale's on board."
</p>

<p>
"But it ain't bales, captain.  Fact is, a whaler of
ours, the brig <i>Resolute</i>, that touched here eight months
ago, and ought to have returned long since, is lost,
and we've just got word from a vessel that has come
from Kerguelen that in all likelihood the crew are saved,
and living or existing on an island a long distance to
the east and south of that black starvation rock."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see.  Well, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's like this.  The brig's well insured, we
don't care a dime about her, and we don't care a dime
about any man Jack on board the <i>Resolute</i>, except one,
and he's one of the firm, Se√±or Sarpinto.  We would
pay handsomely to have him; but, of course, you could
bring the others."
</p>

<p>
"I understand.  Couldn't well leave them, could
we?  And, Mr. Deakin, if I understand you, I'm to
load up with extra provisions, and sail in search of
this shipwrecked crew of whalers, and bring them
here?"
</p>

<p>
"No, you needn't bring them here.  We'll give you
a light cargo for New Zealand, and orders to ship
another there for San Francisco, where our principal
house is, and where Se√±or Sarpinto will desire to be
taken.  Now, Captain Ch&mdash;a&mdash;Cawdor, have we met
the right man in you?"
</p>

<p>
"You've met the identical individual."
</p>

<p>
"And you can start at once?"
</p>

<p>
"The morning after to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Well, captain, here's my card.  Come to the office
this evening before five, and we'll arrange terms.  We
wouldn't lose our partner for a good deal, I can assure
you, sir.  Good-day."
</p>

<p>
"Whew&mdash;ew&mdash;ew!" whistled Captain Cawdor, as
soon as the door had closed on their strange visitor.
"Well, Fred, here's a wind-up to a windy day.  Worthy
Mr. Deakin, of Deakin and Co., doesn't care a dime for
either the ship or the crew of honest whalers, and
owns up to it like a man, or rather like a Yankee; but
they mustn't lose their Se√±or Sarpinto.  Now, take
my word for it, he is the sporting partner, fond of
adventure and all that sort of thing; but he has also
got the dollars, and the worthy firm of Deakin and
Co. would go all to smash without him.  They are
willing to pay, and what is more, they'll have to.  I'll
wager a new sou'-wester a Scot knows how to make a
bargain with a Yankee, see if he doesn't.  Captain
Chowder, indeed!  I'll Chowder him!  Ha! ha!  But
I say, Fred, write your letters home, and be brisk
about it.  There's a tidy cruise before us, but money
in it mind for me, and a bit for you too, lad."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And Captain Cawdor drove a very excellent bargain
indeed with Deakin and Co.  That was the reason,
and the only reason, why, just two days after this,
the sturdy old barque was seen standing away from
the Cape, steering south-south-east, with every inch of
canvas set both 'low and aloft.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br><br>
SOUTHWARD HO! TO THE SEA OF ICE.
</h3>

<p>
In a fortnight's time the <i>San Salvador</i> had
placed at least one thousand miles betwixt
her and the Cape of Good Hope.  This was
looked upon by Captain Cawdor as fair running,
considering the wild weather the barque
experienced.  They had put out to sea on a
glorious summer's day, on the wings of a gentle breeze,
the hills behind them purple and green with vegetation
and flowers; white-winged gulls sailing around them
in the sky or floating on the hardly ruffled breast of
ocean, the good old ship seeming to wish to linger near
that lovely land.  But hardly had the last seagull
shrieked its wild farewell, and night and darkness
begun to fall over the waves, than it could be seen,
from the rising clouds, the moaning wind, and incessant
sheets of lightning, that a tempest was brewing.  So
sail had been at once shortened, and everything done
that could be done to secure safety and comfort for the
night.  Luckily the wind had come from the right
quarter, so that although it blew big guns, and though
green seas were shipped over the bows and came roaring
aft, the good ship went tearing on, and daylight
saw her staggering almost under bare poles, amidst
such a chaos of mountain waves as probably is only to
be seen in one part of the world, and that the ocean
regions round the Cape.
</p>

<p>
And from that very day, all along, the wind had
never entirely ceased to rage and roar, nor stormy seas
to dash around the ship.  She was always half battened
down, especially forward, where in galley and
mess-places lamps had to be burned all day long, and where,
even down below, the decks were never dry.  Little do
boys who long to be sailors know of the hardships
that men before the mast, aye, and apprentices also,
have to endure in such latitudes as these, when the
ship is far, far from land, and when no one knows or
can guess what fate has in store for himself or his
ship.
</p>

<p>
It was a trying time, but worse was to follow.  I
must say, however, that the men never grumbled, nor
did they snarl and growl at each other like
ill-conditioned curs, as sailors so frequently do under like
circumstances, until verily the vessel they live in
becomes a kind of hell afloat.
</p>

<p>
Fred Arundel was as much of a favourite forward
as he was aft.  His open, laughing, good-tempered face
seemed to bring sunshine with it wherever he went.
Nor was he ever too high and mighty to lend a
helping hand wherever needed.  Any day you might
have seen Fred hauling away at tack or sheet, or
even in a wild sea-way taking a dash aloft with
the hands, and laying well out on a yard, helping
to shorten sail.  The men loved and respected him
for all this, but they never took advantage of his
good nature.
</p>

<p>
Many a dark night too, when it was not his watch,
Fred would mingle with a group forward, and listen to
their yarns, or even tell one himself.
</p>

<p>
As I have said, the crew was chiefly composed of
Scotchmen.  Well, Fred lent them books to read, just
the kind he knew would please them.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes of an evening, when the captain was below
with his boots off, Fred would promise the men a
song, and they would slip aft and station themselves
near the skylight.  Then Fred would go below.
</p>

<p>
"D'ye mind having the skylight open a wee bit?"
Fred would ask of his jolly skipper.
</p>

<p>
"You young rascal!" the latter might reply, "I'm
up to your dodges.  You want to play to the men, not
to me."
</p>

<p>
"That's it," Fred would say, laughing, and next
moment big Quambo would have the skylight open;
that is, of course, if the weather wasn't altogether too
rough.
</p>

<p>
Then Fred would play and sing.  It might be the
melting melody of "Auld Robin Gray," or "Afton
Water;" or something more martial and bold, such
as the "March of the Cameron Men;" or "Cam' ye by
Athole?"  But while he sang he never failed to hold
the men entranced.
</p>

<p>
"Land ahead, sir!"
</p>

<p>
It was a shout from the look-out on the fore-top.
</p>

<p>
"Hard up with her!" cried the mate, and presently
the land was brought well on the bow.
</p>

<p>
Only just in time, however; for what had seemed
like a mass of cloud on the eastern horizon had
suddenly resolved itself into black, beetling rocks,
with a fringe of green on top, and waves foaming
like cataracts at the foot thereof.  So near to some
of the outlying rocks or "whales' backs" had they
come that they only just missed grazing them.  As far
as they could make out, the land now visible belonged
to the Grozet group of islands.  Soon afterwards they
sighted land to the north.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the wind was fair and the day fairly clear;
but it was an anxious time with Captain Cawdor until
he got fairly clear of these lonely isles of the southern
ocean.
</p>

<p>
These unknown seas of the far south are much
more fraught with danger, than even the shifting
sands and coral reefs of African shores.  On the
latter, so long as a man is kept in the chains, and
soundings carried on, the vessel is comparatively
safe, for the water shoals gradually; but in such
latitudes as those in which the <i>San Salvador</i> was
now sailing the lead was of little use.  On dark
nights heaven alone knows what dangers were not
narrowly escaped, for by day oftentimes the first
indication they had of the vicinity of a semi-submerged
rock was the appearance of breaking water
at that particular spot.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "There is a sweet little cherub sits up aloft<br>
  To look after the life of poor Jack."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Perhaps, and really this cherub was all the captain
of the <i>San Salvador</i> had to trust to in the inky
darkness of the night; but two very substantial
cherubs were always in the foretop and cross-trees
by day, and often one of these bore the blue eyes of
Fred Arundel.
</p>

<p>
Kerguelen Isles at last.  Blackness and desolation.
Only the wild birds, that flocked and flew in myriads
about the cliffs and rocks; only an occasional seal, or
the head of a monster sea-elephant raised above the
black water, to gaze wonderingly at the ship under
sail, which, if the beast thought at all, he must have
taken for some gigantic bird.
</p>

<p>
The captain landed in a bay.  Yes, people had been
here, and lately too.  Whalers perhaps, or shipwrecked
mariners; but no signs or sounds of human life were
seen or heard now, so he came away and the voyage
was resumed.
</p>

<p>
South still.  South and east; and after five days of
rough and tumble sailing, sometimes with showers of
snow driving across the deck and almost choking the
men as they kept watch, on a bright, clear morning the
man at the mast-head once more raised the cry of
"Land, ho!"
</p>

<p>
An island, undoubtedly.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one of the outlying rocks of Donell's Group.
They would have passed it, and sailed on their course
to resume the search for the missing whalers; but
young Fred's eagle eye noticed smoke, and instantly
reported it.
</p>

<p>
"Haul the foreyard aback.  Away, whaler!"
</p>

<p>
These were the orders, and speedily executed they
were.  Out swang the boat, and down, taking the
water on an even keel, and in five minutes' time
Captain Cawdor himself, accompanied by Fred, was
steering away over the blue-black waters for a little
bay in the desolate island.
</p>

<p>
Here, to their surprise, they found two men, and the
joy the poor fellows evinced as the boat's keel rasped
on the shingle was almost hysterical.  They had been
living in a cave near by, and from the way it was lined
with sealskins it was evident enough that they had
not gone short of provisions during their sojourn here,
and that, moreover, despairing of being rescued for long
months to come, they had commenced preparations for
spending the winter in comparative comfort.
</p>

<p>
They had a large boat too, and the first thing that
the captain noticed was the name painted on her
bows&mdash;<i>Resolute</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Why," cried Captain Cawdor, "you are the very
men we have come to seek for.  But where are the rest
of you?"
</p>

<p>
Then the faces of the two men fell, and they looked
at each other confusedly and guiltily.
</p>

<p>
"Bill," said one at last, "better let us make a clean
breast of it."
</p>

<p>
"Right, Nat.  Guess it'll be the same in the end."
</p>

<p>
"We're about the guiltiest men out then," said the
man called Nat.
</p>

<p>
"Mutiny and murder?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sirree; not so bad as that.  Our hands are
clean.  But, sir, we are willing to own up to robbery.
Yes, as base as base could be.  But heaven knows, sir,
we've suffered for it.  Our ship, the <i>Resolute</i>, got in a
gale of wind in the south-eastern ice down here, and
we lost all our boats except this one here.  Then we
took the ice, or rather we were squeezed into a
starvation creek or bay, 'nipped up' and thrown on our
beam-ends on top of a floe.  That's months ago, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Captain Cawdor, "and you and your
mate here stole the only boat, provisioned her, and
escaped in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"May the Lord love you, sir, that's it entirely."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you deserve to be marooned.  If it wasn't
for one thing more than another I'd take your arms
and tools, smash your boat, and leave you here to
perish.  As it is, we'll leave the boat and take you.
Is it far from here where your ship lies wrecked?"
</p>

<p>
"A good thousand miles, sir."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand miles!  And how on earth did you
reach here?"
</p>

<p>
"We kept hugging the ice all the way till abreast of
the islands.  Whenever it came on to blow we drew
up the boat and lived on small bergs.  Ah! sir, I
assure you we're real penitent."
</p>

<p>
"You will have to prove your penitence then by
guiding us to the wreck of the <i>Resolute</i>.  If I find you
false, I shall hang you both to the yard-arm as sure as
my name is Jamie Cawdor."
</p>

<p>
"We'll be true as a needle to the Pole, sir.  Won't
we, Bill?  We swear it."
</p>

<p>
"I swear it," said Nat solemnly.
</p>

<p>
They were then taken on board, and the voyage was
renewed.
</p>

<p>
No time was to be lost now if the men of the
<i>Resolute</i> were to be rescued this year; for the ice-floes
in these regions are constantly shifting, and streams of
bergs in another month would encompass every island
in the southern sea, rendering relief to the castaway
crew an utter impossibility.
</p>

<p>
For two more weeks and over the cruise was continued,
the weather being on the whole crisp and clear
and the wind favourable.
</p>

<p>
Being now about the longitude indicated by the men
picked up from Donell's rocks, the course was changed
and the ship steered south away, till at last the ice
was made.  Although there were many floating bergs
or huge pieces, with green glittering sides and caps of
snow, the main flow was in itself a wondrous sight.
Imagine, if you can, a huge irregular perpendicular
wall of ice of nearly one thousand feet in height, level
on its upper crust of snow, and indented with many
a bay, with the waves dashing in foam high over the
water-line, and forming a ridge of the strangest and
most fantastic stalactites that it is possible to imagine.
Here were caves of ice and grottoes of ice and coral
apparently, with pillars of every shape and size, from
which, when the sun shone, the most radiant and
lovely colours were reflected, rendering the whole
scene dazzling in the extreme.  As the ship sailed
slowly along this scene of enchantment, it was
impossible not to believe you actually saw strange figures
moving to and fro in those fairy caves, figures in
trailing garments, some all white, others green, or blue or
crimson, but all emitting light, and all seeming to
mingle and glide as ghosts are said to do.  Several
times, indeed, Fred could have swore he saw hands and
arms waved towards him, and the more he gazed the
more life-like the ice spirits grew, till at last he was
fain to cover his face with his hands, as a strange
momentary fear came over him that he was losing his senses.
</p>

<p>
The effect of the scene on the men was remarkable.
They stared in silent wonder, not unmixed with a kind
of superstitious awe.
</p>

<p>
At long last clouds banked up and hid the sun, then,
as if the enchanter had ceased to wave his wand, the
spectres fled, and only blue-grey shadows remained to
mark the places where the caves of beauty erst had
spangled and shone.
</p>

<p>
On sailed the ship, on and on.
</p>

<p>
At last, one night, the mate on watch noticed a
bright glare of light far away to the southward and
east, and reported it to the captain.
</p>

<p>
Though it was long past midnight, the two men of
the <i>Resolute</i> were roused and brought on deck.
</p>

<p>
The light, they said, had often been seen.  It was
that from a burning mountain, and was nothing now
to what it sometimes appeared.  Just here, too, they
averred the wreck would be found.
</p>

<p>
So the <i>San Salvador</i> lay to till daybreak.
</p>

<p>
Both Fred and Captain Cawdor were on deck long
before the first faint flush of dawn.  But neither then
nor when the sun crimsoned the waters to the east
were any signs of human life to be seen.
</p>

<p>
Just two hours afterwards, however, as Fred and
his captain sat at breakfast, the mate's watch
being on deck, they heard that officer's footsteps
rapidly advancing along the quarter-deck.
Immediately after the skylight was opened, and the
mate sang out:
</p>

<p>
"Something large and dark lying on top of the snow
in the bay down here, sir."
</p>

<p>
Captain Cawdor and Fred sprang up and rushed
on deck, and presently, while the ship was kept away
in towards the bay, every glass on board was levelled
at that dark spot on the snow.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br><br>
SE√ëOR SARPINTO.
</h3>

<p>
Nearer and nearer sailed the <i>San Salvador</i>,
closer and closer into the bay; and soon the
dark spot resolved itself into something with
a definable shape.  Presently all doubt was
dispelled; it was a ship lying on the ice on
her beam ends, and a few minutes after several
men were seen clustering near her.
</p>

<p>
The captain took the glass from his eye,
</p>

<p>
"There is no doubt about it," he said aloud.  "Yonder
lies the wreck of the <i>Resolute</i>."
</p>

<p>
Then the crew manned the bulwarks, the capstan,
and winch, and cheer after cheer rose on the icy air
of the morning, such cheers as only can be heard from
true British sailors.
</p>

<p>
Was it an echo from the cold and snowy mountain
cliffs, or was it really a cheer in response to theirs, that
now came feebly back over the dark waters?  None
could tell.  But in a very short time the <i>San Salvador</i>
was near enough to see figures running excitedly about
on the ice.
</p>

<p>
They are soon near enough for safety, the anchor
chains rattle out, and the sails are clued; and soon a
boat is speeding shorewards, both Captain Cawdor and
his young friend Fred being seated in the stern sheets.
</p>

<p>
And now I have a strange fact to record; and mind
you, reader, facts are stranger far than fiction, and I
must leave the elucidation thereof to the psychologist.
</p>

<p>
As the boat entered the bay then, and the mountains
and cliffs grew taller and taller, and cast great shadows
across the water, Fred was noticed by his captain to
become strangely excited, and to look more and more
surprised every moment.  He kept gazing around him.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Cawdor," he said at last, clutching his
friend's arm, "am I really and truly awake?  Oh, sir,
everything around me is familiar&mdash;every rock and cliff
and gloomy hill!  Oh, captain, I've been here before!"
</p>

<p>
He looked so wild as he spoke that Captain Cawdor
really began to think he was taking leave of his senses.
But he had more reason to think so immediately afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Fred started to his feet, his cap falling off as he did
so, his eyes staring shorewards, in which direction also
his right arm was stretched.
</p>

<p>
"I knew it!  I knew it!" he cried.  "It is my dream
coming true&mdash;my thrice-dreamt dream!  Look, sir,
look!  Yonder stands Frank himself!"
</p>

<p>
He waved both arms madly above his head,
</p>

<p>
"Frank!  Frank!  Frank!" he shouted, "it is I, Fred
Arundel, your friend, your brother!"
</p>

<p>
He sank down almost exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Captain Cawdor noticed a young man in the garb of
a sailor come staggering along the snow to the very
edge of the black water, where he swayed about, so
that those in the boat were in momentary expectation
of seeing him fall into the sea.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the boat touched the snow edge than
Fred sprang up and leapt on shore, and next moment
the two long-lost friends stood hand in hand gazing
into each other's faces, though neither could speak a
single word.
</p>

<p>
Frank was the first to regain his voice.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, Fred; I knew you'd come."
</p>

<p>
"You <i>knew</i>, Frank?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
"But how?"
</p>

<p>
"I dreamt you would.  That is all.  And night after
night I dreamt that dream again.  It is all God's
merciful providence, Fred.  Heigho!  I feel so happy now."
</p>

<p>
"But how weak you are!  Come into the boat and
seat yourself.  Captain Cawdor, we'll stick to the
boat a bit; the men can go with you."
</p>

<p>
"Take a pull of this flask, my lad," said the captain
in kind tones to Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, thank you; no, sir!" he answered.  "I have
sworn never to touch <i>that</i>."
</p>

<p>
"As you please, boy; but go and sit down."
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you in a word why I refused the captain's
flask," said Frank, when the two were seated in the
stern sheets.  "My dearest friend on earth&mdash;he's not
on earth now&mdash;whom I loved as much as you, because
I hadn't you to care for, fell a victim to accursed rum,
and one night he threw himself into the sea, Fred,
and before my eyes I saw him torn in pieces by
the sharks."
</p>

<p>
What a long story that was that each had to tell the
other of their travels and adventures, since last saying
farewell on the Broomielaw at Glasgow!
</p>

<p>
But it was not all told on the ice here.
</p>

<p>
Fred and Se√±or Sarpinto, with the skipper of the
<i>Resolute</i>, and some of the ailing ones among the crew,
were taken at once aboard the <i>San Salvador</i>.
</p>

<p>
The others remained in camp beside their ship.
</p>

<p>
The skipper, a little dark-skinned Yankee, told
Cawdor at once that he believed it possible to repair
and float the <i>Resolute</i>, and so that very day a picked
crew was sent on shore to work at her.  All the
damage that could be found out about the brig had
been done to her starboard quarter.  Here was a big
hole, but as the vessel lay on the port side, two days
hard work sufficed to make good repairs.
</p>

<p>
Then came the tug of war.  How was she to be
got up?
</p>

<p>
The skipper's plan at once proved the boldness of
Yankee device.
</p>

<p>
He would, he said, blast the ice from under her.*
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* A plan I have seen resorted to in Greenland more than once.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Would this not damage the ship?" said Cawdor.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, sirree," was the reply.  "We'll sink the
keg of powder well under, and it will be the easiest
work in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we'll try," said Cawdor.
</p>

<p>
So preparations were immediately commenced.
Luckily the weather continued fine.
</p>

<p>
A stout hawser was fastened to the <i>Resolute's</i> main
mast head, and carried towards that of the <i>San Salvador</i>,
which had been brought near the ice floe and anchored
there.  This was done with the view of causing the
<i>Resolute</i> to take the water keel down, else she might
actually turn turtle as it is called.
</p>

<p>
All being ready the keg of powder was lowered,
and lighted by means of a long fuse.
</p>

<p>
Then ensued a long time of anxious waiting.
Minutes on minutes seemed to elapse before the
explosion actually took place.
</p>

<p>
When it did so, instead of being anything very
startling, it resolved itself simply into the raising of
a vast balloon-shaped fountain of salt water and spray
which blinded everyone it fell upon.  Pieces of ice
also fell with rattling thuds upon the deck of the
barque, but no one was hurt.  The <i>San Salvador</i>
shook and shivered and swayed about for a few
moments; huge lumps of the <i>d√©bris</i> of the blasted
iceberg thundered against her sides; then it could be
seen that the <i>Resolute</i> was slowly righting herself on
an even keel, and sinking down to her water-line.
</p>

<p>
All speed was now made to cut the hawser, but
there was no further danger.  The rescued brig lay
there like a duck upon the water; sail was soon after
made, and both vessels moved slowly out to the open
waters of the bay.
</p>

<p>
Much to everyone's surprise the <i>Resolute</i> made
scarcely any water; so the Yankee skipper's daring
had been well rewarded.
</p>

<p>
Next day a strong breeze sprang up from the south-west;
and, taking advantage of it, away went the
consorts under all sail <i>en route</i> for New Zealand.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Nothing, I think, affords such convincing proof of
the limitedness of the human mind as the futility of
the attempts we sometimes make to grasp or understand
the infinitely great or the infinitely small.  We
are willing enough, for instance, to take it for granted
that the milky way on which we gaze on some still
starry night is in reality a mist of myriads on myriads
of worlds and suns, millions of which are as large in
comparison to our mite of an earth as a crownpiece is
to a pin's head; but if we attempt to form any just
conception of so great a marvel we feel our own littleness
at once.  Again, we may be told that every drop
of stagnant water under the microscope resolves itself
at once into a world in which creatures live, and move,
and have their being, and act out their own little
life-stories on their particular stage just as we do in
ours.  We can grasp this truth; but take it in the
aggregate, and where are we?  How many drops of
stagnant water are in yonder pond?  And how many
microscopic worlds are there?  We are best to leave
all such calculations alone.  They do but stagger and
stun us.  Besides there is the golden hope given
us in the Bible, that though here below we see
darkly in a glass, our hereafter will be more bright
and intellectual.
</p>

<p>
I am led to make these remarks from a glance I
have just taken at a map or chart of the world, and
that portion of it in particular we call the Pacific
Ocean.  On this map of mine the islands that dot its
vast surface are fairly well marked to the extent of
our present knowledge.  But probably not a thousandth
part of them are down here, nor have ever been visited
even.  And when we consider that most of them are
teeming with life&mdash;with animal, human life even&mdash;and
are the homes of creatures and peoples utterly
foreign to us, as are also their fauna and flora, the
thought is indeed somewhat startling.  Then to think
of the ages and ages that have elapsed during the
formation of this mist of islands, whether by the
breaking into pieces of vast continents, or the raising
from the ocean's bed of isle upon isle by volcanic or
coral agency!  Is it not weirdly strange?
</p>

<p>
It is in the very centre of this wondrous mist of
islands that the next scene of our story opens.
</p>

<p>
The vessels <i>San Salvador</i> and <i>Resolute</i> had reached
New Zealand, and both had loaded up and were on
their way home to San Francisco.  Frank was strong
and well again now, and had been transferred from his
own brig to the <i>Salvador</i>, and proving to be really a
fairly good sailor, Captain Cawdor had kept his promise
to Fred, and duly installed him in the position of third
mate.  So all had gone well, and the two young men
now felt as happy as the day was long, and just as
bright as the days were.
</p>

<p>
Se√±or Sarpinto had also preferred to leave the brig
and sail with Captain Cawdor.  Frank was very fond
of this Spanish grandee, as he called him.  To all
appearance there was not much of the grandee about
him.  He was a man of about forty years of age, small
in stature, but as strong and lithe as a puma; his dark
eyes at times used to glare and glitter when he talked,
as if fires really raged within him that could not be
concealed.  His love of adventure and sight-seeing was
remarkable.  This it was that had determined him to go
with the skipper of the brig <i>Resolute</i> to the southern
seas, where whales and seals were said to swarm.  This
same love of adventure had made a rover of him all
his life.  He was wealthy, extremely so.  He did not
tell anyone this boastingly; he simply admitted it, and
added that he could not help being rich.  He believed,
he said, if he were stripped naked, and put down in
the midst of an unknown island, he would become a
wealthy man in less than ten years.  He was born to
sprout and flourish like a green bay-tree, and every
new speculation he turned his thoughts to was
successful.
</p>

<p>
Yet he would have been deeply offended at anyone
who ever hinted that he cared for money.  No wonder
Deakin and Co. would have been sorry to lose so
fortunate a partner as this Se√±or Sarpinto.
</p>

<p>
Not a part of the world, even the most remote, he
had not visited, or if such regions did exist, they
existed but to be visited some day or other by this
same adventurous Spaniard.
</p>

<p>
Being therefore a citizen of the world it will
surprise no one to be told that the English he spoke
was faultless.
</p>

<p>
During the long voyage to New Zealand from the
southern ice he had made quite a favourable and
friendly impression on Fred, and never did he seem
more happy than when sitting between the two lads on
the quarter-deck of an evening, smoking and drinking
sherbet.  He would not sit in the dark, however.
</p>

<p>
"I must see the faces of those I talk to," he said.
</p>

<p>
So wherever at night the se√±or sat on deck a lantern
was swung.
</p>

<p>
The lads were never tired listening to stories of his
strange life and adventures; they were thrilling in the
extreme.  At the same time they were natural and
naturally told.
</p>

<p>
Yet with all his nonchalance and his gaiety our
heroes often noticed that at times there came into his
face a look of weariness, nay, at times, even of utter
woe, that used to sadden while it surprised them.
</p>

<p>
They were old enough and wise enough to know
from this that Se√±or Sarpinto had a life-story he never
told; that deep down at the bottom of his heart was a
well-spring of sentiment, no drop from which ever in
their presence found its way to the surface.
</p>

<p>
There was no need to hurry, this voyage, the se√±or
told Captain Cawdor over and over again.  Life among
the beautiful islands of the southern Pacific was far
too delightful, far too idyllic to be hurried over.  But a
ten-knot breeze had the same effect upon both Cawdor
and his mate that a red rag had on a bull.  It excited
them, and clap on sail they would.
</p>

<p>
So the only way Se√±or Sarpinto could think of for
delaying the voyage, was to ask for a boat to visit every
island they came any way near.  The voyage was all
that could be desired for a fortnight and over.  Then
contrary winds blew.  This state of affairs was
succeeded by a hurricane or tornado that blew both
vessels very much out of their course.
</p>

<p>
It was a night of fearful darkness and storm; but
next morning, though the waves were still houses'
high, the wind had fallen to a dead calm.  But where
was the <i>Resolute</i>?
</p>

<p>
Her lights had been seen at eight bells in the middle
watch; but when the sun shot up at half-past six, and
apparently changed the round, rolling waves into blood
and fire, the brig was nowhere visible.
</p>

<p>
Here was Se√±or Sarpinto's chance come at last then,
to delay the voyage for a short time.
</p>

<p>
He could never think of leaving his good brig and
his faithful skipper, so he told Cawdor; but the
captain really could not help perceiving that it
mattered very little to the se√±or where the <i>Resolute</i>
was.  So he told him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! then," was the reply, "for courtesy and
politeness' sake we will lie to for some days till she
comes up.  Or we will creep around and look for
her."
</p>

<p>
But the <i>Resolute</i> never appeared.
</p>

<p>
The waiting for her, however, led to events that
were indeed but little looked for, as we shall presently
see.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br><br>
A FAIRY ISLE&mdash;THE LOST BOAT.
</h3>

<p>
Not a breath of wind, not a sigh came over
the sea.  Never a cloud as big even as a
man's hand in all the bright steel-blue of
heaven's great dome, only the slightest pearly
haze lying low on the horizon wherever one
might look, and all between the glittering sun-kissed
ocean.
</p>

<p>
It was no dead ocean this, however, on which our
heroes, leaning over the bulwarks and talking almost
in whispers, were gazing.  No, the great sea was not
dead, but sleeping.  Note the gentle heaving of its
placid bosom, rising and falling as if 'twere imbued
with the breath of life.  The white-winged sea-gulls
that float on the water seem to have been lulled to
sleep, too, by that swelling motion.  Even the ship
herself nods drowsily to and fro, and the useless sails
half fill and flap to every dip of the masts.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the surface of the sea is all a-glitter in the sun's
rays; but it is not the sheen that sailors love, the
reflection is like that from polished pewter, and forebodes
either a long dead calm, or a sudden storm coming
in a direction no man can even guess at.
</p>

<p>
There is languor in the tropical air to-day.  Even
some frigate birds appear to feel it, for they have
alighted with their long, drooping wings on the
top-most yards, and hardly care to fly again.  The gulls
sail slowly but silently round the ship, as if too
indolent even to scream; yonder nautilus, or Portuguese
man-o'-war, that looks as if it had borrowed its cerulean
colours from the azure of the sky itself, can scarcely
move along.  There is not wind enough to fill even its
dainty sails, and see, what is that lying over yonder
dark and curious?  Fred Arundel lazily lifts the glass,
and gazes in that direction.
</p>

<p>
"It is a shark," he says with half a shudder, "asleep,
I think, in the morning sunshine, and with sea birds
perching on its fins."
</p>

<p>
Frank answers not.  His eyes are riveted on some
far-off green-fringed mountains.  It is an island, but
it does not seem to lie in the sea.  No, it is up in the
sky, and floating there like a veritable fairyland.
</p>

<p>
Now Frank yawns and stretches himself, and next
moment a hand is laid on his shoulder, and he looks
up to see Se√±or Sarpinto standing smiling beside him.
He is in dressing-gown and slippers, with the
never-failing cigarette between his lips.
</p>

<p>
"My young friend is tired."
</p>

<p>
"Si, se√±or," says Frank, "I am tired&mdash;tired doing
nothing.  I'd fain be yonder."
</p>

<p>
He points to the distant island.
</p>

<p>
Se√±or takes the telescope, and looks long and
earnestly at it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he says, or rather sighs, "what a land of
delight it is!  And all the islands around here, how
rich and varied!  Young Frank, the day will come
when each will bear its own happy population of
prosperous white men.  There are not even savages on
yonder isle.  It waits but for a Christian population.
And there is wealth yonder too, wealth untold!"
</p>

<p>
Fred looks at the Spaniard in some little surprise.
He had never heard the man talk thus enthusiastically
before.  Then a happy idea appears to strike Frank all
at once.
</p>

<p>
"Se√±or," he says, "you have influence with the captain.
Ask him for a boat, that we may visit yonder isle."
</p>

<p>
"I will not go there to-day," replies the se√±or,
shrugging his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Frank's face falls.
</p>

<p>
"There is not a banana nor a cocoanut in the ship,"
he says with a faint smile.
</p>

<p>
Se√±or looks at him quizzingly.
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" he answers, "it is not the banana, it is not
the cocoanut my young friend wants, but the wild
adventure.  Well, he shall not be disappointed."
</p>

<p>
Away below hurries the Spaniard; but he soon
returns laughing.
</p>

<p>
"You are to take the gig, your friend Fred, Quambo
for your porter, little Cassia-bud for your coxswain and
to climb the cocoanut-trees, the dog for companion, and
one man besides.
</p>

<p>
"But I have promised you will return as soon as the
flag is hoisted at the peak."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cry Frank and Fred both in one breath,
and in five minutes more down rushes the boat, and all
are in and off.
</p>

<p>
The young men wave their caps to the se√±or, who
kisses his hand.  Then they seize the oars, and off they
push.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, but," cries Fred, "the occasion demands a song,
and Quambo here is capable of a capital bass."
</p>

<p>
And for twenty minutes at least those on board the
ship could hear the music from the distant boat come
quavering over the waves, and for some time could
even distinguish the words&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast;<br>
  The rapids are near, and the daylight is past."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
At long last Se√±or Sarpinto sees the green of the
distant island swallow them up, as the boat appears to
have climbed the very sky itself into that floating
fairyland.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Hours and hours went by, the sun had mounted
higher and higher, and for a time blazed almost
perpendicularly down on the broiling deck, then gradually
begun to decline.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Captain Cawdor, "the lads must have
had enough of it now.  Hoist the recall, Mr. Nelson."  This
to the mate.
</p>

<p>
The mate did as he was told, and the flag hung from
the peak like a red rope, for there was no wind to lift
its heavy folds.
</p>

<p>
Two minutes after the mate shouted, "Stand by there
forward, lads; there is a puff of wind coming."
</p>

<p>
And sure enough patches of wrinkles began to
appear here and there on the gloss of the sea's surface,
as if handfuls of sand had been thrown on it.  Soon
these catspaws gather force and come together.  The
frigate-birds wake up and throw themselves from the
yards, the seagulls are screaming now, the sails catch
the breeze and bellow out.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the wind comes from the right direction,
so she is kept away, and steered for the distant island.
</p>

<p>
Distant island?  Yes, yonder green island that
appears to float in the sky.  The fairy-isle, as the lads
called it, while they went singing and rowing towards it.
</p>

<p>
The se√±or had gone forward to the bow, where around
the weather bulwarks was a group of men with a
puzzled half-frightened expression on their faces.  No
one speaks; but a dozen hands are pointed in the
direction of the green island.
</p>

<p>
It has strangely altered in appearance.  The hills
are lower.  It has lengthened out along the horizon.
It is receding as the ship advances.
</p>

<p>
Se√±or beckons to the captain, who comes hurrying
forward, and speedily turns his glass towards the
island.  Just then some clouds that had come up out
of the sea with the wind abaft obscure the sun, and
lo! the fairy isle disappears, as if suddenly engulphed in
the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Hardly knowing what he is doing, the captain keeps
bewilderedly sweeping the sea for a time with the
glass; but never a sign of land is to be seen, only the
clearly defined line 'twixt ocean and sky, for the haze
has lifted or melted away.
</p>

<p>
A strange wave of superstitious dread rushes over
the hearts of the men standing there near the winch,
and one or two of them are deadly pale.
</p>

<p>
A sailor, more bold than the rest, clutches the
captain's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Tell us, sir," he gasps, "What does it all mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Alas! lads, it means a mirage."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, sir, but I take leave to doubt it."
</p>

<p>
"You do?"
</p>

<p>
"I do, sir.  That island lasted too long and clearly
for a mirage."
</p>

<p>
"And you think?"
</p>

<p>
"I think, sir, that the isle we saw was as solid as
the ship we stand upon, and that it has sunk."
</p>

<p>
"Such things have happened," said the captain.
"At least they tell me so; but&mdash;&mdash;.  No, no; the
island was a mirage.  Yet, none the less, the boat is
lost."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The wind that had been blowing steadily from the
east now began to fall, and in a very few minutes it
was once more a dead and strangely impressive calm.
</p>

<p>
But clouds were now banking up in every direction.
A curious blackness had overspread the sky to the
nor'ard; a blackness that appeared to be steadily
advancing, blotting out the sea as it came, and
accompanied by dancing, quivering lightning, that
appeared to run along the surface of the water.
Ominous thunders too began to roll, and before
sufficient sail was taken in the storm had burst all
round them.
</p>

<p>
For a time there was only mist and blackness, but
shortly the rain came down in sheets, the thunder-claps
were deafening, and the sea looked like sheets
of fire.  Anon the wind came, and such a wind.
Little sail had been left on her, but the squall appeared
to lift the great barque almost out of the water.  For
a moment she plunged bows first into it, quivering all
over from stem to stern like a stricken deer; then, as if
fear lent her fleetness, she dashed forward and tore
through the wind-chafed ocean, with a speed that the
oldest sailor on board had never seen equalled.
</p>

<p>
All that day the wind blew with hurricane force,
and all the next night, then once again the weather
cleared.  But a gloom that could not be dispelled
had settled over the ship, and when four days afterwards,
after searching fruitlessly for the lost boat, the
<i>San Salvador</i> bore up once more on her course, all the
life and soul seemed clean gone out of every man on
board.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most unhappy man of all was Se√±or
Sarpinto.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said over and over again to Captain
Cawdor, "I'd rather have lost all my fortune than
that this terrible affliction should have befallen us."
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir," said the captain, "we must not
repine.  We are all in the hands of a merciful
Father, who knows what is best for His children
here below."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Sarpinto, "you are good, Captain
Cawdor, you are good.  But do not try to cheer
me up, I must and shall repine.  It is my comfort
to repine, for, captain, was not the fault all mine,
and now I have lost the only being I seem ever to
have loved on earth&mdash;save one.  All my good fortune
appears to have deserted me, and my life is closing
in darkness and gloom."
</p>

<p>
What words of consolation could Captain Cawdor
find to assuage grief like this?  He stretched out his
hand and grasped that of the se√±or.
</p>

<p>
"I too am in grief," he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, yes!" cried Sarpinto.  "I had forgotten.
Forgive me, my poor friend.  I am selfish.  But now
for your sake I will try to be brighter, happier."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br><br>
"WHAT THEIR FATE WAS TO BE THEY COULD NOT EVEN GUESS."
</h3>

<p>
After the boat left the <i>San Salvador</i>, with
little Cassia-bud steering, and the great
Newfoundland, Hurricane Bob, lying at his
feet by way of balancing her, and keeping
her well down by the stern, "Steer right
away for the island," cried Fred.  "We are going to
row and sing, and never look behind us."
</p>

<p>
But when they had rowed for fully half an hour,
and the ship looked very far away indeed, Frank, who
was stroke, lay on his oar, and the others followed
suit.
</p>

<p>
"Why," he said, peeping round, "we ought to be
there by now."
</p>

<p>
"Dear me!" cried Fred, "how deceiving!  The
island looks as far away as ever!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and it has altered in appearance somehow,
hasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, of course; but then we are low down in the
water, you know.  Anyhow, I'm hungry and thirsty
both.  Happy thought, to have a rest and some
lunch."
</p>

<p>
The good things were brought out accordingly, and
everybody, even Hurricane Bob, shared and shared
alike.  Then Quambo lit a huge pipe, and Magilvray,
the sailor&mdash;a stout young fellow with a merry-looking
face of his own&mdash;bit a huge quid off a stick of
niggerhead, and began to look very contented indeed.
</p>

<p>
After another half-hour's pulling catspaws began to
creep over the water, and a sail was hoisted.
</p>

<p>
"We'll soon be there now," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after there was a cry from the little
black coxswain.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, massa Fred, I's so frightened!"
</p>

<p>
"Whatever is the matter, Kashie?"
</p>

<p>
"See, sah, see!" he cried, pointing away ahead.
"De island done go clear away out ob de world, sah!"
</p>

<p>
It was difficult indeed for any one in the boat to
believe his senses.  Every one felt dazed, and looked
dazed.  The island was gone sure enough; yet how or
whither seemed inexplicable.
</p>

<p>
But the wind kept increasing every minute, and to
go back now in the teeth of it was utterly impossible.
So on and on the little boat flew for a time.  The sea
had got up so high too, all at once, that they were afraid
to venture on lying to, and to lower sail meant being
pooped by the racing, threatening waves.
</p>

<p>
How long they ran before the wind they never could
tell.  They had given themselves up for lost, however,
and sat there in the gathering gloom of the awful
thunder-storm silent and despairing, like men without
hope and energy.
</p>

<p>
Fred himself had taken the tiller, and Cassia-bud
was crouched in the bottom of the boat, hugging his
friend Bob in abject terror.

<a id="p222"></a>
But if Fred and Frank were puzzled by the disappearance
of the fairy-isle, as they had called it, their
astonishment knew no bounds when the boat was
suddenly caught up by a huge wave, and hurled
forward into a chaos of broken water and roaring
breakers.  Hurled into it?  Yes, and hurled over it,
into water that was as smooth as a mill-pond stirred
by a summer's breeze.  Behind them and away in a
circle all around breakers foamed and roared and
thundered.  There was the quick, incessant gleam of
lightning from out the blackness of the weather clouds;
but yonder, not a hundred yards away, was an island,
low and almost level, but fringed with cocoa-nut trees,
and with an undergrowth of waving palms and other
tropical shrubs.
</p>

<p>
In five minutes' time the boat was drawn up on the
snow-white coral beach, and the thunder-storm had
burst over them in all its violence.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by the sky partially cleared, and though
the wind still blew high they crept out from the
shelter of a cave in which they had found refuge, and
began seriously to consider their position.
</p>

<p>
It was some time, however, before the whole extent
of their misfortune was fully realized by them.
</p>

<p>
But as the time went on, and the hurricane appeared
to be again on the increase, causing them to seek for
shelter once more in the cave, a hurricane such as no
ship dare attempt to lie-to in, then indeed hope began
to die out in their hearts, and they <i>felt</i> they were alone.
They felt this still more when the sun went down, and
pitch darkness almost immediately followed.
</p>

<p>
They dared even yet, however, to hope against hope;
the ship would surely return and seek for and find
them.  It was gloomy enough in this cave certainly,
with the wind tearing through the scrubby jungle and
the cocoa-nut palms that covered the little island, and
with the awful boom of the breakers on the circular
reef of coral surrounding the lagoon, but then it was
only for a night.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Only</i> for a night," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>only</i> for a night," reiterated Fred.
</p>

<p>
"If we had a light, though, it would be all the
more cheerful."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, well I have matches, but there is nothing here
to light."
</p>

<p>
"We'd better keep the matches," said Frank. "Are
you sure you have them safe and dry?"
</p>

<p>
"But why so anxious, lad?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  I&mdash;&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, brother, don't think of it!  I'm going out to
feel for the boat and fetch the supper."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll go with you."
</p>

<p>
In the darkness this was no easy task, and the wind
was so high they had to bend low, almost crawling in
fact.
</p>

<p>
But they were lucky enough to find the food, and a
portion being handed round to everybody, not forgetting
Bob, all hands did justice to the good cheer, and then
Quambo and Magilvray lit their pipes, and the cave
was more home-like after that.
</p>

<p>
They sat talking there till it must have been far
into the night, then, lying back on the soft, warm sand,
one by one they dropped off to sleep.
</p>

<p>
They had not even thought of setting sentry.  What
was there here to be afraid of?  Nothing, surely.
Besides, the great, honest dog, Hurricane Bob, always
made a point of sleeping with one eye a little open, so
if anyone was sentry that night it was Bob.
</p>

<p>
The sun was high in the heavens when Fred awoke
next morning, and shouted to his companions:
</p>

<p>
"What's for breakfast?" said Frank, sitting up and
rubbing his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! what indeed?" said Fred, laughing.  "Why we ate
all our breakfast last night.  But where is Cassia-bud?"
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud was not to be seen, but presently he
appeared out of the jungle laden with cocoanuts and
pandany.  This pandany or pandanus is the screw
pine, which grows on nearly all the islands of these
regions, and is one of the first to appear when coral
reefs assume the shape and substance of islands, the
seed being either floated thither on tree trunks or
brought by birds.
</p>

<p>
Finding the cocoanuts had been a far too easy task,
for every tree was levelled almost to the ground, one
alone being left standing.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast Fred and Frank set out to explore
the island, leaving the others on the beach with the
boat.  This exploration did not occupy much time, the
whole island being only a few acres in extent, and
scarcely anything growing on it except the few cocoanut
trees, and the strange-looking scrubby pandanus.
This tree, the leaves of which are like big vegetable
corkscrews, grows from roots that are above ground,
like the legs of a milking-stool, somewhat after the
fashion of the mangrove trees of African shores.
</p>

<p>
The wind had almost died away, but the breakers
still thundered on the reef that surrounded the lagoon.
I trust I make the position of our heroes clear enough;
the little island was nearly round, and entirely
surrounded by a broad natural moat, let us call it, of
water, which in its turn was encircled by the coral
reef.  The moat, however, was about seventy yards
wide or more all round.
</p>

<p>
They now launched the boat, and embarking pulled
right round the inside of the reef, with the view of
finding out the lane therein that led to the sea.  They
did so at last, but it was so narrow that the presumption
was, they had been carried right over the reef itself,
on the previous day, by a high tidal wave.
</p>

<p>
Like nearly all Scotch boys who are brought up in
the woods and wilds, Fred Arundel could climb trees
well.  It did not take him very long, therefore, to
shin to the top of the solitary cocoanut tree, although
it was fully forty feet in height.  It afforded a splendid
ocean view all around, and Fred managed to unsling his
telescope, and scan the horizon on every side.  As far
as he could make out never a ship nor sail of any
kind was visible, but his heart beat high with hope
and joy when, away towards the south, his glass rested
on what appeared to be the hills or mountains of some
island in the midst of the sea.
</p>

<p>
His hopes fell again, however, when he thought of
the fairy island that had lured them away from the
ship the day before.  This also might be a mirage.
Well, if it were so it would dissolve away; they could
but wait and see.  So he came down again to report.
</p>

<p>
It was far on in the afternoon before they succeeded
in getting enough dry stuff to light a fire withal.
</p>

<p>
Meantime Cassia-bud, who had constituted himself
caterer and lions' provider, had found some huge crabs,
and having killed them they were cooked in their
shells, and a very delicious meal they made, washed
down with a drink of cool milk from young cocoanuts.
</p>

<p>
When they had dined more bark was heaped upon
the fire, and green stuff spread over that in order to
raise as dense a smoke as possible.  For trailing across
the blue sea of the tropics smoke may be seen a very
long distance off.
</p>

<p>
Before sunset Fred once more ascended the tree or
look-out station, as he called it, and once more scanned
the horizon.  It was much clearer now, but no sail
was visible.
</p>

<p>
But to his joy the island in the south was still there.
So he concluded it must be real.
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud had been paddling about in the lagoon
all by himself, and just as the sun was dipping low
towards the ocean he landed, and with a face that
positively beamed with joy he threw down five
beautiful fish at Fred's feet.  They were beautiful in
colour as well as in size and substance.  "How lucky
we were to have brought fishing-gear with us," cried
Fred; "and really, Kashie, you're a perfect treasure."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Quambo had cleared the fire and erected
a tripod of sticks over it with cross-pieces, and on this
the fish were hung, and soon began to fizzle and steam.
</p>

<p>
Fred and Frank were lying on the smooth white
sand, watching Quambo's preparations for supper.  "I
say, Fred," said Frank, "what does this remind you of?"
</p>

<p>
The tears rushed to Fred's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank, I well remember!  You are thinking
of our Crusoe life on the desert island in Scotland.
Ah! dear me, and now we are Crusoes in stern reality."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you wish that Toddie was here?  Dear wee
Toddie and the little dog Tip."
</p>

<p>
"I do and I don't.  I wish we could only bring back
old times, when you and I were young, though."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! well, we're not very particularly old yet, are we?"
</p>

<p>
"Supper is all ready, sah," said Quambo.  And a
glorious supper it was; for everyone was gloriously
hungry.
</p>

<p>
The only part of yesterday's provisions that still held
out was the salt.  For in his hurry, when coming away,
Quambo had rolled an immense piece in a table napkin.
</p>

<p>
There was enough fish left for breakfast, but they took
the precaution to stow it away in the locker of the boat.
</p>

<p>
Next day and another and still another passed
monotonously away, and it was now evident to all
they might never expect to see their ship again.  And
do as they would, they now began to feel lonely and
cheerless.
</p>

<p>
They were prisoners in this cockle-shell of a coral
island, and the hope of being picked up seemed very
remote indeed.  Meanwhile what about food even?
The fish might possibly fail them, the robber crabs
might keep aloof, and they would soon eat up all the
cocoanuts and pandanus fruit in the place.
</p>

<p>
To remain here, therefore, was but to wait for death,
and to attempt to get away was&mdash;well, what was it?
</p>

<p>
"What do you think about it, Frank," said Fred one
evening, as they all lay on the soft sand, with the
cheerful light of the camp fire flickering in their faces.
</p>

<p>
"About what?" said Frank, whose thoughts had
been far, far away indeed.
</p>

<p>
"Why about attempting to escape?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we are, very likely, a thousand miles and over
from any civilized settlement!"
</p>

<p>
"Quite true, but the island yonder, for it is no
mirage, affords us the chance of life that this island will
very soon deny us."
</p>

<p>
"How far does it seem to be off, sir?" said Magilvray.
</p>

<p>
"As near as I can judge, about forty miles."
</p>

<p>
"A long pull, sir."
</p>

<p>
"True," said Fred; "but better, I think, to start early
on a calm day and pull all the way, than trust to the
treacherous winds of these regions, which in half an
hour may increase to hurricane force."
</p>

<p>
"That is so, sah, for true," said Quambo.
</p>

<p>
"Then," said Frank, "supposing we manage to land
there, what next?"
</p>

<p>
Quambo smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
"What are you thinking about, Quambo?"
</p>

<p>
"I think, sah, dat if sabages lib on de island yonder,
dey soon cook us all and gobble us up plenty quick.
Dat all, sah."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Quambo," said Frank, "that would be all."
</p>

<p>
There was silence for a time after this, a silence
that Fred Arundel was the first to break.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," he said solemnly enough, "I believe I have
thought the matter out in all its bearings.  To me it is
evident enough, that our only chance of life lies in
an attempt to reach yonder island, and if death it is
going to be, surely it is better to die at once, even at
the hands of savages, then stay here to be slowly
starved to death."
</p>

<p>
"That is just what I think too, sir," said Magilvray,
"and what is more, the sooner we set about it the
better."
</p>

<p>
So it was resolved that very night, that all preparations
for the daring voyage should be gone into next
day, and that on the day following, if the weather
were favourable, they should leave the island.
</p>

<p>
Fred slept more calmly that night than he had
done since they landed.  Before lying down he had
gone away by himself for a little distance into the
jungle, and kneeling down beside a fallen tree, prayed
long and earnestly that He who had hitherto protected
and guided him through many a danger, seen and
unseen, would condescend to bless their little
enterprise, and grant them hope and safety.
</p>

<p>
He sat for some time on the tree stem, for the stars
were shining very brightly and clearly, then slowly
returned to the cave, and threw himself down on the
warm white sand; and thinking of home and the dear
ones in the fisherman's cottage, he was soon fast asleep.
The preparations for the voyage were few but
important; namely, the procuring and cooking of a
good supply of food.
</p>

<p>
But fortune favoured them.  They loaded their boat
therefore the night before, and as soon as day broke
over the ocean they rowed out through the narrow
opening in the reef, and headed away for the distant
island.  What their fate was to be they could not even
guess.  They trusted all to God.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br><br>
"A LAND FLOWING WITH COCOANUT-MILK AND HONEY."
</h3>

<p>
A day of more anxiety or of greater fatigue
it would have been difficult to conceive, than
that which our heroes endured, in their
perilous voyage towards the unknown island.
The sun blazed almost perpendicularly down
on them at mid-day.  Both Fred and Frank
had been red before, but now it seemed as though they
would soon be burned as black as Quambo or Cassia-bud
himself.  So fierce was the sun's heat that neither
of the lads could partake of the food they had taken
with them.  Their thirst became almost unbearable at
last, and the cocoanut milk, or rather water from the
young nuts, which they drank, appeared rather to
increase than to assuage their thirst.  What would
they not have given for a draught of cool spring water
from the little rill that trickled from the rock near the
igloo at Methlin!  Strange that they should have both
been thinking about this at the same time, but so it
soon turned out.
</p>

<p>
"I know where I should like to be, Fred, just for
five minutes," said Frank, as they paused for a
moment's rest.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I know!" cried Fred; "at the igloo fountain!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, lying under the rocks there, and watching the
water trickling through the green grass and the rushes,
and laving my brow with it, and filling my hands with
the clear water, and drinking from my hands."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shouldn't!  I should stick my mouth right into
the well at the foot, and I don't think I would ever
stop drinking."
</p>

<p>
It is not to be wondered at that in their dire
extremity the boys talked thus; for I have found from
experience that the next best thing to eating food or
drinking water, when you are very hungry or thirsty,
and cannot get any, is to think of it.  This is natural,
and seems to soothe one.  When lying ill of a burning
fever on African shores, I remember that in my dreams
I used to fancy myself wandering by rippling burns in
my far-off home in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
To-day Cassia-bud was coxswain as usual, but
towards afternoon, when thoroughly faint and weary,
many a look behind them did the rowers cast.
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, they found that when still
three miles at least away from the island the current
was so strong it began to be a matter of doubt whether
they should ever reach it.
</p>

<p>
The boat's head was kept well up therefore, and all
hands redoubled their efforts to send her on.  Fred
even started a song, but for once in a way this was a
failure.  There was nothing for it but to struggle on
in silence.
</p>

<p>
At long last they got clear out of the race of the
tide, and now it remained to find a landing-place.
</p>

<p>
The island was a very lovely and romantic-looking
one indeed, an island evidently formed at first by
volcanic upheaval, but now green-clad, to the summit
of its strangely-shaped hills, with a luxuriance of
tropical vegetation such as no one in the boat had ever
seen surpassed.
</p>

<p>
It was doubtless the reflected image of this beautiful
isle of the sea, that had caused the mirage which lost
our heroes their ship.
</p>

<p>
They now lay on their oars for a time, to rest and
think.  It seemed evident that the island was
uninhabited.  Never a canoe was seen anywhere near it,
nor were there any signs of hut or habitation by the
beach, and never a vestige of smoke.
</p>

<p>
However, it appeared to be a very large island, and
as yet they had seen but a portion of it.  They first
made the northern end of it; but here all around was
a wall of black beetling crags frowning over the sea,
the waves dashing up the sides of it and breaking into
snow-white foam with a booming noise, that, mingling
with the cry of sea-birds, made a wild and weird-like
chorus on the still evening air.
</p>

<p>
There was no time to be lost, for the sun was
rapidly declining; so, noticing that the dip of the hills
trended to the southward and west, they made haste to
row in that direction.  The crags got lower and lower,
but jutted out to sea at last, forming a cape or rocky
promontory.  Once past this, they found a coral reef
lying all along the tree-shaded shore, about three
hundred yards distant from it.  On this the breakers
were dashing with great force, and tossing their white
arms high in air.
</p>

<p>
They rowed along the edge of this terrible barrier;
and just as they were about to despair of finding an
opening, beheld in front of them a narrow, very narrow,
creek of unbroken water.
</p>

<p>
"Hard a-port, Kashia!  Round with her, boy!"
</p>

<p>
"Ha'd a-po't it is, sah!" cried Cassia-bud.
</p>

<p>
Round came the boat like a beauty, and next moment
they were carried right into a splendid reef-locked
harbour, large enough for the whole British navy to
have lain snugly and comfortably in.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven be praised!" said Fred with a sigh, as he
paused to wipe the perspiration from his brow.
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes more they had landed.
</p>

<p>
The sun was by this time nearly touching the water's
edge; and almost before they had time to draw the
boat well up, and find shelter from the dews of night
under some friendly boughs, his last rays were tinging
the foam of the breakers with crimson.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Quambo, open me a nice green cocoa-nut,"
cried Fred.  "I can drink now, and presently I think
I'll be able to eat as well."
</p>

<p>
Tired in the extreme though every one was, supper
was eaten and thoroughly enjoyed.  But soon after
this Nature would not be denied; and although a
daring attempt at conversation was made, it utterly
failed, and one by one the Crusoes dropped soundly off
to sleep.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The shadows of the mountains lay across the reef-locked
harbour when Fred Arundel awoke next morning.
The others were fast asleep, little Cassia-bud as usual
with Hurricane Bob's paws drawn round his neck.  So
Fred got quietly up, and walked down to the beach.
How clear and cool the water looked!  How serene
and beautiful the morning!  The temptation to bathe
was too great to be resisted, so he divested himself of
his garments, and was soon splashing and swimming
about to his heart's content.  He had gone but a little
way out, however, and was just thinking how delightful
it would be to swim right away over to the reef and
back, when his attention was attracted by the strange
conduct of the Newfoundland.  He was running along
the edge of the beach, not only barking, but positively
bellowing.  A sudden and terrible fear at that moment
got possession of Fred's senses.  His very heart grew
cold.  He seemed to feel as powerless for the time
being as a person under the spell of some hideous
nightmare.  It was gone in a second or two, and he
was hastening towards the beach.  He never looked
behind him till safe on shore.  It was well for him
perhaps he did not, for a glance told him then that
the water was teeming with monster sharks.  The joy
of the dog appeared to know no bounds, and if it had
not been for this faithful fellow, poor Fred would
undoubtedly have met a terrible fate.
</p>

<p>
As soon as breakfast was finished, it was determined
to make an exploration of Good Hope Island, as they
had named it.  For aught they knew it might be
inhabited by savages, in which case, instead of being
"monarchs of all they surveyed," they would very
soon be slaves, if indeed their lives should be spared.
</p>

<p>
It was arranged, therefore, that Magilvray and
Hurricane Bob should be boatkeepers, and remain on
the beach, while Fred and Frank went towards the
hill-tops to make a general survey, and Quambo with
little Kashie should "spy out the land" with reference
to its food resources.
</p>

<p>
That the island was inhabited, Fred and his friend
had not to advance far before finding out.  The jungle
was seemingly impenetrable at first, and while forcing
their way through it they came upon some very ugly
customers in the shape of snakes.  Whether harmless
or otherwise it was impossible to tell.  When, however,
they found one hanging to the branches of a tree they
considered it best to give it a wide berth.
</p>

<p>
If there were no more dangerous beings in the island
than snakes, they made up their minds that they would
be content and thankful.
</p>

<p>
Presently as they got upon higher ground the trees
got larger and more sparse.  They soon found themselves
on the ridge of what was evidently the highest
mountain in the island.  Owing to its being so well
wooded it was seldom they could catch a glimpse of
the world beyond; but soon it ended in a bare bluff
covered with rough withered grass, and studded here
and there with cactus bushes.
</p>

<p>
In less than half an hour they had reached the top,
and sat down to rest.  And lo!  all the island, with its
hills and dells and forests, and its wonderful flowering
trees, was spread out at their feet, and all around was
an unlimited expanse of ocean, asleep in the morning
sunshine.  For the most part the sea was blue, yet a
blue so soft, so ethereal, as surely no artist in this
world ever yet transferred to his canvas.  Along the
reefs that guarded the island were long lines of
snow-white&mdash;the breaking water&mdash;and two sides were bounded
by beaches of silvery sand.  But as far as eye could
reach not a dot nor particle of land was at first to be
seen, with the exception of the little isle, with its
rock-girt lagoon, which they had left yesterday morning.
</p>

<p>
They seemed to be right in the centre of a lonesome
ocean, and in all probability on an island that was not
even marked on the chart.  Of this, however, they
could have no certainty.
</p>

<p>
How very still it was up here on this high hill-top.
The slightest sounds could be heard from below.  Their
camping ground, on the beach, must have been a good
mile off, yet every now and then they could distinctly
hear the deep mellow bark of the great Newfoundland
dog.  Somewhere in the woods, busy at work doubtless,
were Quambo and Kashie, for occasionally their merry
ringing laughter was audible enough.  Nearer still were
heard the joy-songs of thousands of happy birds; and,
mingling with all, the drowsy monotone of the waves
breaking on the coral reef.
</p>

<p>
Fred and Frank sat for quite a long time in silence,
but by the look of calmness on the face of each, their
thoughts could not have been unpleasant.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Frank," said Fred at last, "what do you
think of the outlook?"
</p>

<p>
"What, the scenery or our prospects?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, both for instance."
</p>

<p>
"Why I never saw more charming scenery in my
life.  Its very lonesomeness, I think, is its chief
charm.  Just look at that immensity of sea stretching
all round us, Fred.  If it were not so blue and so
bright it might be even a little eeriesome in its very
lone beauty."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Frank; but don't you see that very lonesomeness
may prove our safety?  With my glass now, just
away out yonder, I seem able to raise the peak of a
mountain, but it is very far away.  I daresay it is an
inhabited island, and very likely there is a group of
them.  Well, Captain Cawdor told me that all the
islands for hundreds of miles around were filled with
races of implacable savages and cannibals.  But I think
we are too far off to be visited by them.  If they did
come, heaven only knows what would happen, because
we are not nearly numerous enough to fight them; so
I am sure we are perfectly safe."
</p>

<p>
"So am I," said Frank, "and I feel very much
inclined to enjoy the <i>dolce far niente</i> and just let things
slide."
</p>

<p>
"So do I.  Wouldn't you rather be a barrister
though than a Crusoe?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Fred, just think of being stowed away in a
stuffy cobwebby old office in smoky London, and
thinking nothing about, or knowing nothing about,
such a glorious free and easy life as this.
</p>

<p>
"True, Frank, and to think that it is not a long time
since we were away down at the bottom of the map, as
you might say, in the darkness and cold that reigns
perpetually around the southern sea of ice!  And to
think, Frank, that I should have found you there!"
</p>

<p>
"That is the best of it.  Oh, it just had to be,
Fred!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," replied Fred, "I'm so glad.  And do you
remember the vow we made when little chaps, and
while playing at Crusoes in Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"What, to be brothers, Fred?  Yes, lad, and here I
do renew it."
</p>

<p>
Once more hands were clasped and eye met eye.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers yet," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers ever," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
Then hand in hand down the hill they went towards
the camp singing&mdash;singing quite as gaily as the
bright-winged birds that hopped from bough to bough in
those beautiful sunny woods.
</p>

<p>
They lingered here and there in glades and openings
to gaze and wonder at the marvellous display of life
everywhere spread out before them in jungle and
forest.  The air was filled with the hum of myriads
of insects, the ground and ferns and bushes of every
sort were instinct with life and joy, and happiness too,
apparently.  The beetles even were a sight to see, in
their gorgeous metallic tints of blue and green and
crimson, and the butterflies that floated from flower to
flower, on shrub or tree, looked like splendidly-painted
fans, while a rich and luscious perfume filled the air,
that in some of the more sunny glades was almost
overpowering.
</p>

<p>
Quambo and Cassia-bud were both back before our
heroes.  They came smiling to meet them.
</p>

<p>
"Well, boys," said Fred, "I see you're back, and I
know you haven't come empty-handed."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, massa!" said little Kashie, seizing Fred
by the hand.  "Run quick and see, massa."
</p>

<p>
He led Fred to the boat.  Why the stern-sheets
were laden with luscious fruit, even the names of
many of which neither Frank nor Fred could tell.
Nor had these faithful blacks forgotten to bring
flowers.  But this was not all, for Kashie pointed
triumphantly to a dozen "sonsy" fish he had caught,
and Quambo tapped the boat's breaker significantly&mdash;it
was filled to the brim with pure, delicious water.
</p>

<p>
Nor had Magilvray been idle all the forenoon.  He
had not only a clear fire burning and ready to cook the
dinner, but he had, by cutting down green boughs,
succeeded in making a cool and delightful tent, that
should be impervious to the heaviest shower that could
fall.
</p>

<p>
Fred, as he looked around him at all these
preparations for health and comfort, could not help
laughing with very joy.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Frank," he cried, "and boys all, fortune has
taken a turn for the better, and led us to a land that
is literally flowing with milk and honey."
</p>

<p>
"Cocoanut milk and honey, yes," said Frank,
laughing in his turn.  "There are certainly busy bees
about."
</p>

<p>
Then down the two brothers threw themselves in
the cool, green shade to talk and build castles in the
air till dinner was ready.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br><br>
A TERRIBLE APPARITION.
</h3>

<p>
They spent the afternoon dreamily wandering
about in the woods or on the beach; for Fred
and Frank, not being used to real hard
manual labour, had hardly yet got over the
fatigues of the day before.  But Quambo and
Magilvray were not so idle.  They were busy
cutting down the dead branches in the jungle, and
bearing them to the beach to serve as firewood.  They
soon had an immense pile handy.
</p>

<p>
So all the evening, from half-past six, when it fell
dark, till everybody turned in for the night, the camp
fire was kept alight.  Not that heat was needed by
any means, but simply because, as Fred phrased it, "it
looked cosy."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And now, although these marooned mariners determined
to take life easy, and make themselves as happy
and comfortable as circumstances would permit, they
took means, nevertheless, by which it was possible that
the attention of some passing ship might be arrested,
and so perchance their deliverance effected.  This
consisted in erecting a beacon on the hill-top, and on the
very next morning they set about the work.
</p>

<p>
For once in a way little Cassia-bud was left, in
company with Hurricane Bob, to mind the camp, while
the others betook themselves to the mountain.  Under
the circumstances the task of preparing and hoisting
the beacon was by no means a very simple one.  It
was easy to find a tree long and straight and tall
enough, but having no other tools but their jackknives,
it took a very long time indeed to cut it down,
to trim, and hoist it.
</p>

<p>
At first it was proposed by Frank, and seconded by
Magilvray, to turn the beacon into a kind of flagstaff,
the flag itself being a large piece of spare canvas that
happened to be in the boat.
</p>

<p>
"There is this objection to your plan," said Fred,
laughing, "canvas doesn't make much of a show as a
flag; it doesn't dry easy after a shower; and if it once
gets wound round the pole it will cling like death to a
dead nigger.  No, I say let it be a beacon; and I've
heard Daddy Pop remark, in days of old, Frank, that
there is no beacon so effective as a broom."
</p>

<p>
"All right then," said Fred, "let us hoist the
broom."
</p>

<p>
So the broom-beacon was hoisted accordingly; and
if the reader wants to know what it looked like when
up, let him imagine a tall and sturdy flagstaff with a
huge bunch of branches attached to the very summit
of it.
</p>

<p>
It looked splendid, I do assure you, and was not only
visible from the camp, but capable of being seen from
far at sea.  After it was up, and the pole firmly fixed
by means of stones rammed well home by hitting them
hammer-fashion with other stones, Fred took off his
cap, and waving it round his head timed his companions
with a "Hip, hip, hip!" to three rattling good British
cheers.
</p>

<p>
"Wowff&mdash;wowff&mdash;wowff!" that was the sound of
Hurricane Bob's voice in response to the cheers, and it
was afterwards discovered that little Cassia-bud, well
knowing that his own feeble cheering would not be
heard, had excited the dog to bark.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Magilvray, looking up at the broom,
"I must say, young gents, as how I'd 'ave preferred
seeing a flag flyin'.  The broom looks Dutch, don't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! by-the-by," said Frank, "Mac is right,
Fred.  There was a great Dutch admiral, you remember
who once hoisted a broom at the mainmast head, and
swore he wouldn't take it down again till he had swept
the British from the seas.  What was his name?  Von
Trump, or Von Dunk, or something, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Van der Decken!" said Fred seriously.
</p>

<p>
"You're laughing at me," said Frank.  "But come
on, men, I'm as hungry as a tiger, and nothing to eat
but cold fish and fruit when we get home."
</p>

<p>
No wonder, indeed, that all hands were hungry; for
hoisting the broom had taken them nearly the whole
day.
</p>

<p>
They reached the beach about two hundred yards
from the camp.  Cassia-bud had heard them coming
along through the bush, and had run along the white
soft sands to meet them, Hurricane Bob bringing up
the rear.  Kashie was breathless, not with running, but
with fear.  It must be remembered he was little more
than a child.  The giant Quambo took him up in his
arms, and clinging to his big friend's neck he cast
frightened glances seawards, looking the very picture
of abject terror.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, massa!" he gasped, looking piteously at Fred,
"I'se seen de debbil, and I not want to stop any more
all by myse'f near the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Seen the devil, Kashie!  What do you mean, boy?
When did you see him?  What was he like, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sah, he like one awful big fish, bigger than a
boat, sah!  He jump right up out ob de sea one, two,
tree time.  Jump right high up in de sky; and he all
black, wid awful eyes, sah, and, oh! sah, <i>he had nuffin
on but his head</i>.  It was de debbil, sah, fob true."
</p>

<p>
Fred and Frank both burst out laughing, but the
poor child seemed really and truly scared nearly out of
his wits.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fred, "it is evident Cassia-bud has seen
something.  But surely the island is haunted!  What
a fearful apparition!  The head of a fish as big as a
boat, and awful eyes, or, as Kashie calls it, a fish with
'nuffin on but his head,' leaping black against the blue of
the sky.  Horrible!"
</p>

<p>
It took quite a long time to comfort Kashie; but when
at last Fred said, "Well, come along, Kash, I'm hungry,
bring out the cold fish," then Kashie wriggled out of
Quambo's arms, and off he ran in front.
</p>

<p>
It would be hard to say whether our hungry heroes
were more pleased or surprised to find that the boy had
cooked them a capital dinner of roasted fish, crab, and
plantains.  The latter ate like mealy potatoes.  Moreover,
he had been up in the bush, and had found plates
growing on the trees, big broad scented leaves of the
lemon <i>Hibiscus</i>, and beside each plate stuck in the soft
sand was a green cocoa-nut all ready to drink.*
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* The green cocoa-nut contains scarcely any kernel, but about
a quart of most delightful, cool, and delicious water.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Poor little Kashie gradually grew happier now, and
was soon his laughing white-toothed rolling-eyed little
self again.  And as for the others, they had not felt so
cheerful and merry since they had been accidentally
marooned.
</p>

<p>
I must say here at once, and be done with it, that one
cause of the extra jollity exhibited by Quambo and
Magilvray, was rooted in the fact that on this very day
the giant negro had found a species of wild tobacco
growing on the mountain side.  I think it is called <i>krava</i>
or <i>grava</i> by natives of Polynesia.  I only judge by the
sound.  However Magilvray said to Fred more than once
that evening that a load was lifted off his mind.
</p>

<p>
"I don't mind wanting rum or coffee," he said, "but
better 'ang me at once, sir, than cut off my bit o' baccy.
So here's good luck to 'Ope Island, says I."
</p>

<p>
And with that brief speech Magilvray took a large
drink from his cocoa-nut, and stuck it in the sand
again, with a look of satisfaction that was most
refreshing to behold.
</p>

<p>
Long after the sun went down that night there was
bright moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Only half a moon was shining it is true, but the air
being so clear everything was almost as bright as day
in England.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say to a row on the lake to-night?"
said Fred.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, happy thought!" cried Frank, "a row and a song."
</p>

<p>
The sheet of smooth water betwixt the reef and the
shore was called the lake by our Crusoes.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed a lovely night; a bank of coral-white
clouds lay low on the horizon, otherwise the dark blue
sky-depths were studded over with silvery stars of
singular brilliancy, while the moon shed a broad band
of clearest light across the rippling sea.
</p>

<p>
Shorewards the hills, and glens, and groves of cocoa
palms were softened and spiritualized by the moon's
mellow rays.
</p>

<p>
To-night Magilvray stayed at home with little
Kashie, while Quambo and Frank rowed the boat, Fred
took the tiller, and Hurricane Bob stood in the bows.
</p>

<p>
But Fred had another duty to perform, he had to
lead the singing.
</p>

<p>
What a happy, hopeful time is youth!  Here were
our two heroes cast away on a lonely island in the
midst of the sea, far removed from the tracks of
commerce, with no means of communicating with the
outer world&mdash;buried alive one might say&mdash;yet on this
bright, beautiful night, rowing about on the placid
bosom of the bay, as devoid of all thought and care
as if sailing on Loch Lomond or Windermere.  Some
portion of the happiness they felt, and the hopefulness
too, was undoubtedly due to the climate itself.  The
air here is so pure, the breath of the ocean, mingling
with the spicy odours from off the island, so balmy, so
life-giving, that only to exist is to live, only to have
being is calmness and content combined.
</p>

<p>
For two whole hours they rowed up and down their
lake, singing the songs of their far-off native land,
only desisting now and then to lean on their oars
and talk of home and dear old times&mdash;times that
appeared to their young minds already long buried
in the distant past.
</p>

<p>
They were slowly paddling along the inside of the
reef, just beyond the range of the falling spray.  But
this last was but little to-night, for the tide was well
out, and there was scarcely any swell on.
</p>

<p>
Yet the sound of the breaking waters was very
soothing, and caused them to linger longer alongside
the reef than they might otherwise have done.
</p>

<p>
Fred was just clearing his throat for another song,
when he was attracted by the strange attitude of the
Newfoundland.  The dog was standing with his forepaws
on the gunwale of the boat, his ears were forward,
his hair on end from head to tail, and uttering a low,
half-frightened, but ominous growl.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the dog," cried Fred.  "He sees or hears
something on the reef or over it."
</p>

<p>
The idea of savages in their canoes at once occurred
to Frank, for nobody was even yet sure that the
island was entirely uninhabited.
</p>

<p>
"Better pull a little way in, I think," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Give way then," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
The oars were silently dipped into the water, all
three men listening intently at the time, with their
faces turned towards the reef.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly on the other side of the surf they distinctly
heard a hustling, rushing, fearful noise, accompanied
by a low but startling cry, as of some creature
in dire distress.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer with almost the speed of a rocket
it seemed to come, then ceased entirely, but at the
same time, betwixt them and the moonlight, at least
fifteen feet high in the air, they beheld an apparition
that, in such a situation, was enough to frighten the
boldest man that ever lived.
</p>

<p>
It was simply the great black head and two fins&mdash;no
more apparently&mdash;of a monster fish with goggle eyes
and open mouth.  It took the water near the boat,
raising a wave of breaking water that all but swamped
it, and was seen no more.
</p>

<p>
When Fred looked up he saw both Quambo and
Frank crouched down almost in the bottom of the
boat, though it was half full of water.
</p>

<p>
Frank was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on us!" he cried.  "What was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Favaroo! favaroo!" said Quambo.  "That is <i>favaroo</i>."  His
voice trembled as he spoke.  "A devil fish; de
evil spirit bite all away his body one day, and now
he go everywhere trying to find he."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" cried Fred, laughing now, "that is really the
awful creature that little Kashie took for 'de debbil
that hadn't got nuffin on but his head.'  It is a
sunfish as big as an elephant."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Frank, "I've heard of such visitations,
but I didn't know the beast could jump like that before.
Let us bail out the boat.  Why she is half swamped!"
</p>

<p>
"What a mercy the monster didn't fall on us.  Where
would we have been, Fred?"
</p>

<p>
"Look there," said Fred, pointing over the gunwale.
</p>

<p>
Frank gazed fearfully in the direction indicated.
Two monster tiger sharks were floating quietly about
near the boat.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Fred sprang to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, men," he cried, "where is the dog?  Where is
poor Hurricane Bob?"
</p>

<p>
The question was by no means difficult to answer.
Without doubt in the extremity of his terror he had
sprung overboard, and been instantly devoured by the
sharks.  What a sad and sudden ending to a moonlight
concert!
</p>

<p>
Bob was a favourite, not with Cassia-bud only, but
with everybody, and to lose the noble fellow, and lose
him thus.  It was altogether too shocking to think
about!
</p>

<p>
Straight away for the shore they rowed now, but in
silence all.  They had received a shock that it would
take weeks to get over.  Not from the terror of the
apparition, but from the loss of the honest dog, who
had really come to be considered one of themselves.
</p>

<p>
Their astonishment and delight therefore may be
better conceived than described, when, as soon as the
boat rasped upon the silvery sand, Hurricane Bob
himself came joyfully bounding and barking to meet them.
</p>

<p>
Instead of attempting to get into the boat again he
had simply headed away for the beach, and landed in
safety.  But, strange to say, the dog from that day
forward could seldom be prevailed upon to go even a
little way into the water, and when taken anywhere in
the boat he invariably crouched down beneath the
thwarts, lying there quietly until once more safe on
shore.
</p>

<p>
But the adventure of this evening quite cleared up
the mystery, of Cassia-bud's "debbil with nuffin but
his head on."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br><br>
A SWIM FOR DEAR LIFE&mdash;PURSUED BY SHARKS.
</h3>

<p>
As long as the moonlight lasted the evenings
were very pleasant indeed, and every night
Fred, Frank, and Quambo went out for a
row and a song.  Hurricane Bob begged so
earnestly to be excused that it was thought
best to leave him on shore.
</p>

<p>
Magilvray and Cassia-bud also expressed themselves
as perfectly content to take a back seat at the evening
concert, or, in other words, to lie on the beach and listen
there.  Probably they thus had the best of it; for the
sound of the singing floating over the water was weirdly
tremulous and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
The singers, however, thought it safest to keep well
away from the reef.  There was something decidedly
uncanny in the sight of that black and terrible
apparition springing over the reef.  Besides, as Frank said,
if that was the brute's usual way of coming home of an
evening, the wisest plan was to give him a wide berth.
Explorations of the island, which was many miles in
extent, took place every day.  These little excursions
formed a very pleasant way of spending the greater
portion of the day, there was so much that were
strangely foreign and beautiful to be beheld, and so
many pretty peeps of scenery.  The whole island,
indeed, and everything in it, was as different from
anything that Fred and Frank had seen before, as if it had
been part and parcel of some other planet.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it was Cassia-bud who came with them,
at other times Quambo or Magilvray, and sometimes
it was Hurricane Bob only.  Whoever stayed at home
had to cook the dinner, and just as often as not had
to catch it also.
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud was the fisher-boy <i>par excellence</i>.  He was
never better pleased than when out on the water all by
himself, armed with rod and reel, or with hand-line
only!  His whole evenings used to be devoted to the
study of bait, and when he went fishing he seemed to
know the very spot at which to sink his line in order
to procure some particular kind of fish.
</p>

<p>
He found several species of skates and rays, a huge
kind of conger-eel&mdash;the first he caught frightened poor
Cassia-bud, and almost as much as "de debbil fish"
had&mdash;many other nameless and curious fishes, all good to
eat, and mackerel.  These last were not such as we in
England are used to, but cooked as Quambo cooked
them they were very delicious indeed.  They were
very numerous too in some parts of this reef-locked
bay, and Quambo's plan was to start Cassia-bud out to
catch two or three just half an hour before dinner, and
pull on shore with them immediately.  The fish were
killed and cleaned, then cut up the back after the
fashion of kippered salmon, and roasted before a clear
fire.  Served hot then with the acid juice of a species
of lemon that grew on the Isle of Good Hope, they
made a dish that might have graced the table of a king.
</p>

<p>
About every second day a visit was paid to the top
of Beacon Hill, and the horizon eagerly scanned for
sight of some passing vessel.  Had any such appeared a
huge pile of brushwood, both withered and green, would
have been kindled in hopes of attracting attention.  But
days and weeks flew by and no sail was ever sighted.
</p>

<p>
When men are stranded on an island as our heroes
were, it is always the first month or six weeks that
seem the longest time.  After this the Crusoe or Crusoes
settle down more, and the time flies more quickly on.
</p>

<p>
As to reckoning the days, Fred and Frank were not
reduced to the necessity of notching a tree, for one of
them happened to possess a note-book with an almanack
in it, and every noon one day was ticked off.
</p>

<p>
Of wild beasts the island possessed not a single
specimen, but a curious kind of coney or cavy, they
could not tell which, even after Cassia-bud one day
succeeded in shooting one with a bow and arrow he
had made.  Cassia-bud roasted the beast and ate
it for supper, for the lad had a wonderful appetite.
Bob enjoyed the bones.
</p>

<p>
"Was it nice?" said Frank.  "Did you enjoy it,
Kashie?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sab, he just too awful jolly for anything!"
replied the boy, licking his lips and rolling his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Kash, you must shoot some more you know,
and then perhaps we'll all have a taste."
</p>

<p>
These creatures were to be found in very great
abundance on one particularly rocky glen, where they
had their burrows.
</p>

<p>
On the very next morning, after receiving his
commission, Cassia-bud and Hurricane Bob both
disappeared in the woods, and about noon emerged again,
Bob carrying a coney that he himself had captured,
and Cassia-bud carrying four.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried Fred, picking the lad up as soon as
he had thrown down his burden; "now for a game of
live-ball to make Kashie hungry."
</p>

<p>
"Play!" he shouted, pitching the little laughing
black ball of a boy towards Quambo.
</p>

<p>
"Play!" cried Quambo, throwing him to Magilvray.
</p>

<p>
"Keep the pot a-boilin'," roared Magilvray, and
next moment Frank had caught the lad and pitched
him back to Fred.
</p>

<p>
They kept the game up for ten minutes.  It was as
good as dumb-bells, Fred said.  The rule of the game
was, that when anyone dropped the live-ball on the
sand he was to stand out.  At last there was nobody
in except Quambo.  He hoisted Cassia-bud right up
on his shoulders, and there the boy stood erect while
the giant went capering up and down the sands, with
Hurricane Bob barking around them for joy.
</p>

<p>
Well, Cassia-bud's conies, or cavies, proved most
delightful eating, and were quite a change from fish
fish, fish morn, noon, and night.
</p>

<p>
But it must not be supposed that because there were
no wild beasts in the island, there were no wild
adventures to be had.  No; for there was the sea, and
adventure is inseparable from the briny ocean.
</p>

<p>
It would be difficult indeed to say how many different
species of sharks there were in the bay.  Quambo was
rather an authority on the natural family <i>Squalid√¶</i>,
and both Fred and Frank had seen a shark or two in
their time.  Well, there were at all events the blue
shark, the basking shark, the white shark, and the most
dread monster of all, the tiger shark.  This last was
admitted by the other species to be <i>facile princeps</i>, for
whenever one appeared the others modestly retired.
</p>

<p>
Strange as it may appear, Cassia-bud had not the
slightest fear of these awful demons of the sea.  But
an adventure he had one day while fishing was surely
enough to scare the senses out of any boy one whit
less brave.
</p>

<p>
He was fishing as usual one afternoon when Fred
and Frank had got home earlier than usual from their
woodland rambles, and were lying on the sands
watching his sport.  The boy had caught about a dozen
or more good-sized fish, stringing them one by one as
he did so on a long, supple wand, that after he landed
he could carry across his shoulder&mdash;so many fish
behind, so many in front of him.  Every now and then
near Cassia-bud's boat the ominous-looking fins of a
huge shark could be seen protruding from the water.
The very sight made Frank's spine feel cold.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, to their horror, they noticed that in
leaning over the gunwale of the gig and hauling in his
line, to which it appeared afterwards a huge conger
was attached, the boat was capsized, and with a
frightened scream Cassia-bud was precipitated into
the water.  Probably there is not an English boy who
lives that would have done what this negro child did
then.  He seized his stick of fish, and commenced
swimming rapidly shorewards.  For a moment or two
perhaps the sharks were frightened off, but they were
speedily in pursuit of the boy.  One, two, three, four
great fins could be counted in his rear.
</p>

<p>
Both Fred and Frank started to their feet, and stood
staring, speechless and aghast.  They would have given
a good deal could they have turned away their eyes
from watching the threatened tragedy.  On and on
came the black, round head, with the frightened face
and rolling eyes, and on and on came the sharks.
</p>

<p>
The onlookers marvelled, however, to notice that
every now and again the pursuing sharks paused, and
their heads seemed to be turned towards each other.
But only for a moment or two; then they speedily
took up the chase again, but only to pause as before.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer comes Cassia-bud.  Greater and
greater becomes the suspense of Frank, Fred, and the
others.
</p>

<p>
Will he be saved?  Can he be saved?  Is it possible
he can elude his fiendish pursuers?
</p>

<p>
But now a new feature is added to the terrible
interest of the scene.  With a howl of rage and terror,
Hurricane Bob comes dashing down the beach, and
with a plash springs far into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud is not twenty yards away when the dog
meets him, and tries to seize him by the shoulder.  But
the boy throws his arms around Bob's great neck, and
in half a minute more both are safe and sound on the
silvery sand.
</p>

<p>
And Hurricane Bob shakes gallons of water out of
his hide, the spray of which makes a circular rainbow
in the sunshine; and Cassia-bud stands there all white
teeth, smiles, and dimples, holding up a solitary
mackerel.
</p>

<p>
"On'y one po' fish," he says, "left out ob all dat
lubley stickful!  On'y one, sah, but I stick to he!"
</p>

<p>
"But how could you have escaped, my poor boy?"
said Fred, who was trembling all over.
</p>

<p>
"Simply dis," said Cassia-bud coolly, "I feed de
sharks all de time I keep swimming, one fish at a time,
you see, massa.  De shark say all de time day chasee
me, 'Go on, little nigger-boy, gib us anoder fish, and
we won't eat you.'  Soon's all dey fish is done den de
sharks gobble de poor boy up plenty quick."
</p>

<p>
"But weren't you dreadfully frightened, Kashie?"
</p>

<p>
"I dessay," said Kashie, "I'se looking radder pale,
cause I 'llow I'se a kind o' sceered."
</p>

<p>
The idea of Cassia-bud turning pale with fear was
so ridiculous, that both Fred and Frank burst into a fit
of hearty laughing, and so happiness was restored once
more.
</p>

<p>
After shaking another gallon of water out of his
splendid coat, and making another rainbow, it seemed
suddenly to occur to the noble dog that his little friend
Cassia-bud really was saved, that the sharks had not
eaten him up; and he was so overjoyed that, after
taking his tongue across the nigger-boy's ear, he set off
to allay his feelings in a mad circular gallop all around
the silvery sands.  Round and round he flew, and
when he was too tired to run any longer, he sat down
beside Cassia-bud and barked at the sea.
</p>

<p>
It really looked as though he was barking defiance
at the sharks, for between every volley of "wowffs"
he turned round and licked Cassia-bud's face, as much
as to say, "Those awful fishes were going to eat my little
Cassia-bud; but they haven't got him yet, nor won't."
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say that the negro lad was one
of the heroes at dinner that day, and Hurricane Bob
another.  For it was evident that Cassia-bud had
meant to hold on to the last fish; and it is just as
evident that this resolve on his part would have cost
him his life, had not Hurricane Bob dashed bellowing
into the water at the moment he did.
</p>

<p>
However, all's well that ends well.
</p>

<p>
About an hour afterwards the boat and the oars also
were picked up on the sands.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br><br>
STINGAREE.
</h3>

<p>
The love for adventure, which four years of a
roving life in so many parts of the world had
engendered in both Fred and Frank, was not
to be bounded by the coral reef that shut in
the bay near which they were encamped.
So whenever there was a breeze with perhaps
a bit of sea on, the Crusoes hoisted sail and, steering
through the gap, went off on a long delightful cruise
around the island or far beyond it.
</p>

<p>
On these occasions Magilvray and Cassia-bud were
usually left to keep camp.
</p>

<p>
More than once, however, the boatmen found
themselves benighted, and had to pass the long hours of
darkness on some lonesome part of the coast, to the
no small anxiety of those they had left behind them.
</p>

<p>
On one of these expeditions they had a strange and
wonderful adventure with the dreaded stingaree, or
huge sting ray of Pacific seas.  While out boating Fred
had several times come across these veritable "sea devils"
floating on the surface of the water, and the desire to
capture a specimen got possession of him.  It would
form a desirable change of diet at all events, for the
red flesh of this fiend-fish is said to be exceedingly
palatable.
</p>

<p>
These "terrible skate," as Frank termed them, grow
to an immense size, some being as much as twelve
feet long without the tail, and nearly ten feet in breadth
of beam.  The strength of a monster like this is truly
astonishing.  But the stingaree is armed with a dart
and spines in his tail that make him the most dreaded
of all fish that swim.
</p>

<p>
Some species have but a single barbed dart at the
end of the tail.  If a human being is struck with this
in the body, there is no chance of life left; for the
dart is poisonous, and a painful, nay even agonizing,
death is the only result that can be looked for.  If the
dart has struck the arm or leg it breaks off, and if it
be not cut out from the other side the flesh soon
mortifies, and the unhappy man dies more lingeringly.
</p>

<p>
But this creature, at least one species, has also the
power to shoot poisoned spines or darts at his foe, and
these latter can pierce even a boat, so hard and strong
are they.  One would have thought that monsters like
these were best left alone.  Fred was of a different
opinion quite.
</p>

<p>
So all preparations were made to go on the war-path
after them.
</p>

<p>
Quambo was for many evenings busily engaged
fashioning the harpoons from a species of very hard
wood found in the island, rendered doubly hard by
being half burned in the fire.  He also made several
long spears from the same tree.  To one of these he
attached a strong double-edged or dagger knife.
</p>

<p>
Assisted by Cassia-bud, Quambo also made a large
number of fathoms of stout rope from fibrous stuff
obtained from the cocoanut and pandanus trees.
</p>

<p>
All being ready the boat was watered and provisioned
one evening, and next day at early dawn, and after a
still more early breakfast, they put to sea in quest of
adventure.
</p>

<p>
There was the slightest bit of a breeze on; just
enough and no more to fill the mainsail, and keep the
boat moving along at the rate of about five knots an
hour.  But there certainly was no occasion for hurry,
and the wind was rather disadvantageous than otherwise,
for it roughened or rippled the water, thus distorting
the vision very much when they attempted to look at
anything under it.
</p>

<p>
While sail was on her, Quambo stood in the bows
on the outlook, Frank managed the sheet, and Fred had
the tiller.
</p>

<p>
They had sailed half way round the island, on tack
and half tack, and were preparing for a run the other
way, and standing more out to sea, when suddenly
Quambo's great bulk was seen to rise more erect and
to quiver about, as he grasped his harpoon.  He looked
indeed like a tiger about to spring on his prey.
Without turning round he motioned with his left hand to
Fred which way he should steer, and next moment,
with a whirring sound, the harpoon flew seaward from
his right.
</p>

<p>
There was the sound of a dull thud; Frank grasped
the gunwale of the boat, prepared, as he afterwards
said, for anything.
</p>

<p>
In a few seconds Quambo drew in his line, and
bursting into a loud laugh at his own expense, turned
about and showed his shipmates the harpoon broken
right across the centre.
</p>

<p>
"No good, then," said Frank, "after expecting such
wild sport and such a capital dinner?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sah," answered Quambo, "not much good.  I
think I see one big stingaree, and let fly.  All de same,
sah; I strike the back ob one big turtle."
</p>

<p>
Fred and Frank both laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Better luck next," said the former.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," said Quambo; "but I not like de wind.
He make too much bobbery on de water all de time,
and I not can see."
</p>

<p>
But early in the afternoon the wind went down,
and the water became as calm and still as a fish-pond.
Sail was taken in and stowed, and Frank got out the
oars.
</p>

<p>
Whole shoals of turtle were seen, but no rays, no
stingarees, so they consoled themselves with dining,
and after a drink of cocoanut water, Frank resumed the
oars, and Quambo, smoking his huge pipe, once more
took his station at the bows.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon wore on, the sun was declining in the
west, and they were all beginning to show signs of
weariness, for the day had been drowsily hot, when
once more Quambo stood erect, grasping a fresh harpoon,
and signing to Fred as before.
</p>

<p>
There was no mistake about the stingarees this time.
The boat seemed to be in the midst of a huge shoal of
them, and in a moment Quambo had hurled the harpoon
into one of the very largest.
</p>

<p>
The commotion that ensued baffles description.  The
huge brute seemed for a time to be right under the
boat, and almost lifting it up.  Then he darted ahead,
and the appearance of the creature now was terrible in
the extreme.  He had come right up to the surface of
the sea, which was red with blood, while not only was
the water lashed into foam by the dart-armed tail, but
by the fins or wings at each side.
</p>

<p>
If ever any creature in the world merited the
name of sea devil, it was that monster stingaree
just then.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Quambo was making lunges at it with
his dagger-pointed spear.  This seemed to lash the
monster to fury at last, and after a dreadful struggle or
two to free itself from the galling harpoon it plunged
forwards and stood straight away out to sea.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Now as the day wore on, after putting the dinner
all ready for cooking&mdash;for our heroes were expected to
return to the island before sun-down&mdash;Magilvray, with
Cassia-bud and Bob, determined to walk to Beacon
Hill.  The road now was easily found, and in less than
an hour they had stationed themselves beside the
broomstick, as it was called, whence Magilvray could
sweep the horizon with the spy-glass.  They were just
in time to see the striking of the stingaree, and witness
the monster's fearful struggle for freedom.  Then they
saw it dash away seawards, pulling the boat behind it
as a salmon might the float of a fishing-line.
</p>

<p>
They saw Quambo's efforts to round in the line in
order to be able to ply his dagger-lance once more;
then they noticed that the stingaree seemed suddenly
to change its course.  They saw Quambo cut the line,
but almost at the same moment the boat turned turtle,
and its occupants were thrown into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh, oh!" shrieked little Cassia-bud.  In his
agony he ran round and round the beacon, then threw
himself on the dog, frantically weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, golly, golly!" he sobbed.  "Poor massa, for
true, dey will all be drown.  De big shark will gobble
massa up plenty quick.  Oh, I not can look no mo'!  I
not can look no mo'!"
</p>

<p>
Not heeding the boy's lamentations Magilvray sat
there as if rooted to the spot.  He saw the boat still
afloat there, bottom upwards, with Fred and Frank
clinging to its keel, after many ineffectual attempts to
right it.  He saw big Quambo swim after an oar, and
picking it up come with it to the bows, and tie it with
the others to the painter; and he could not help
admiring the giant negro's wondrous coolness in what
appeared to be the hour of death.
</p>

<p>
Then a long, <i>very</i> long time seemed to elapse without
any change of scene or situation.
</p>

<p>
Was the boat drifting nearer to the island shore he
wondered, or being carried further out to sea?  At all
events the poor fellows that clung to her keel must
soon sink exhausted beneath the sea, or&mdash;and the
thought made this sailor's blood run cold&mdash;they would
be hauled under water, one by one, by the sharks, and
torn in pieces.
</p>

<p>
Lower and lower sank the sun.  It was already
beginning to shimmer red across the sea.
</p>

<p>
But what was that moving slowly towards the upset
boat and the clinging men?  He brought the glass to
bear on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Horror!  it was the dark triangular fin of a huge
blue shark, and it was moving in the direction of the
boat&mdash;nearer and nearer.  Not always in a direct line
though, and often remaining for a time immoveable, as
if picking up the scent.
</p>

<p>
Magilvray felt as if under the spell of some fearful
nightmare.  Then he sprang to his feet and closed the
telescope with a snap.
</p>

<p>
"I shall go mad, <i>mad</i>," he cried, "if I gaze but a
minute longer.  Come, Kashie, come."
</p>

<p>
"Is it all ober, Mac?" cried the boy pitifully.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Kashie, all over, boy, and we are alone.
Come, boy, come."
</p>

<p>
The sun shot one blood-red glare across the world of
waters, then sank, and all was gloom and night.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Neither Magilvray nor Cassia-bud could ever explain
how they found their way back to camp that evening,
through the rocky glens and the darkling forest.
Perhaps they were beholden entirely to the dog.
</p>

<p>
But they did reach the beach at long last.  The fire
had gone very low, and hardly knowing what he did
the sailor made it up and sat down near it, while
Cassia-bud threw himself moaning on the sands.
Hurricane Bob, satisfied in his own mind that the
boy was ill or in pain, lay down beside him, and gently
licked his face and hands.
</p>

<p>
Dinner was not even once thought of&mdash;grief was
all-absorbing.
</p>

<p>
After a time Cassia-bud probably slept, for he lay
there very still and quiet.  But Magilvray still sat in
the same position, dazedly gazing at the flickering fire.
</p>

<p>
A bright moon, that had been high in the heavens
when the sun went down, sank lower and lower, and
at last disappeared behind the western waves, and the
clear stars had the sky all to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Not a sound now was to be heard, save the moan of
the breaking water on the reef, and occasionally the
eeriesome cry of some belated sea-bird.
</p>

<p>
Why, I have often wondered, are sea-birds sometimes
to be heard at the dreary hour of midnight?  What
takes them away from their rocks at such a time? and
in the darkness too.  Sailors shudder when they
hear them.
</p>

<p>
It is not the call of birds, they will tell you, but of
disembodied spirits.
</p>

<p>
Magilvray half roused himself at last; but he
sought not the shelter of the friendly boughs.  He
only crept a little closer to the fire, shuddering slightly
as if cold, then exhausted nature claimed her due
and the sailor slept.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br><br>
"ROW, BROTHERS, ROW"&mdash;QUAMBO'S SHARK<br>
STORY&mdash;FAST TO A SWORD-FISH.
</h3>

<p>
The night wore on apace.  It must have been
well into the middle watch when there began
to mingle with the toilsome dreams of the
grief-stricken sailor the melody of song, and
the sound of oars keeping time to the rhythm.
</p>

<p>
He woke up at last.
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud was also awake, and both were sitting up,
straining their ears to listen.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there it was again sure enough, very faint and
far away certainly, beyond the reef, but, borne along
towards them on the air of night, it was plainly
audible.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,<br>
  The rapids are near, and the daylight is past."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The song really appeared to come from the sky
itself, and in the sky Cassia-bud evidently believed it
was.
</p>

<p>
"O Mac," he said tremblingly; "I'se dreffully
frightened.  I'se as pale as def (death) with fear.
Po massa! dat song he lub so much when he libin',
and now, Mac, he am dead and is singin' same song in
hebbin.  Po massa!"
</p>

<p>
The music ceased at last, and there was a pause; then
it once more rose on the air, but higher and nearer, and
a song of a different sort.  "Auld lang syne," to wit.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "And surely ye'll be your pint-stoup,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As sure as I'll be mine;<br>
  And we'll spend the evenin' thinking, boys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of auld lang syne."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"No Kash," cried Mac joyfully; "it aint in heaven
they are.  'T aint blessed likely there'd be pint stoups
in heaven.  And I don't think they're ghosts at all."
</p>

<p>
He jumped to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Speak, Bob, speak, boy;" he said to the great dog.
</p>

<p>
Hurricane Bob required no two tellings; he barked
till reefs and hills re-echoed back the sound.
</p>

<p>
Then cheering was heard from seaward, which
Magilvray and Cassia-bud gladly returned, and soon
something dark appeared in the reef gap, and in about
five minutes more our lost stingaree hunters were
standing on the beach, receiving the congratulations of
their friends, whom they had never expected to see
again in life.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kashie is so glad now, massa!" cried the nigger
boy.  "I jes want to run and shout all de while.  And
you is sure you is alive, massa?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe so, Kashie."
</p>

<p>
"And de sharks not hab done gone gobble you up
for true?"
</p>

<p>
"Not one of us.  And now, lads, stir up the fire,
and let us have supper, we're dying of hunger.  That's
what's the matter with us now."
</p>

<p>
"Shall we cook ye a slice o' stingaree, sir," said
Magilvray slyly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, bother the stingaree, Mac!  Don't chaff us
about the beast."
</p>

<p>
"No more stingaree for me," said Frank; "not even
a little bit."
</p>

<p>
Mac was very busy now, and as he set about cooking
the supper Fred told him how they had escaped.
</p>

<p>
They had heard the sharks splashing near them in
the darkness; then, in an agony of fear, they made one
more despairing effort to right the boat, and succeeded.
Fred and Frank got in first, then Quambo.
</p>

<p>
"So you see, Mac, we've disappointed the sharks for
once, and done them out of a good supper, and now
we're going to make a good supper ourselves."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
One evening, about three weeks after the adventure
with the stingaree, as they all lay round the fire, and
Quambo and Mac were blowing great curling clouds of
the wild tobacco, the smoke from which, however, was
not considered Rimmellian by either Fred or Frank,
said the latter:
</p>

<p>
"D'ye know, lads, that I think flying fish is about
the nicest fish in the sea&mdash;to eat I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fred, "I think Kashie here might catch
some."
</p>

<p>
"Fly fish?" said Cassia-bud.  "Oh, massa, you
expects po' Kashie to catch the big debbil dat fly over
de reef, with nuffin but his head on.  Kashie not can
do."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Kashie.  It is the little flying skip-jack
business I mean."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see, sah! de flying herrings, sah?"
</p>

<p>
"A good name too.  Well, Fred, do you know that a
flying fish once saved my life?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! a story?  Eh?  Out with it, Frank.  'Saved
by a flying fish: a tale in two chapters; or, a romance
of sea life!'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, lads, you'll admit there isn't much romance
about it when you hear it.  Scene first then opens
with me lying sick and ill in a hammock on deck, on
board the old <i>Resolute</i>.  We were at sea you know, and
a long way from land.  I must say the skipper was
just as kind to me as he knew how to be.  He used
to bring his bottle of rum on deck, and sit beside me
and drink it for company's sake like; for you know I
wouldn't have any.  He was a very straightforward
chap that skipper, I hope he is still alive and afloat,
though I doubt it very much.  'If ye're so grand
as not to drink the rum, young man,' he said to
me sometimes, 'why I guess the next best thing you
can do is to lie there, and see me drink it.'  Well,
until I gave up eating entirely the skipper had good
hopes of me; but when I lay in my hammock as weak
as a baby, and couldn't pick a morsel of salt junk or
dried cod, then he told me plainly there wasn't a ghost
of a chance for me.
</p>

<p>
"Then we got becalmed, and there was a blue shark,
about twenty feet long, kept close to the ship all the
time, waiting and watching.
</p>

<p>
"'He's waiting and watching for you, young man,'
the skipper told me, consolingly.  'He's a fine big
beast, and you'll fit in there nicely!  Now if you've
anything to say, or if there's anything you'd like done
arter your de&mdash;mise, you had better speak now, for I
calculate ye haven't got more'n a day to get ready.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" I groaned, "if there was anything I could
eat I think I'd get round even yet."
</p>

<p>
"'Well,' he said, 'we're having jest the nicest bit o
corned horse and sauer-kraut for dinner ever ye smelt.
It's just stale enough to be tender.  If ye can't tackle
that I guess ye ain't much good any more!'
</p>

<p>
"That is chapter first, Fred, and now for the romance.
I was lying in my hammock, dozing I think, that same
evening, only looking up at the clear bright stars now
and then, and wondering how far heaven is beyond
them, and if I shall know my dear father when I meet
him there, when all of a sudden some cold splashy
thing jumped right against my face, then commenced a
very lively dance on top of the hammock.  It was a
flying-fish."
</p>

<p>
Frank paused.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fred, "but I don't see where the romance
comes in, or how the creature saved your life."
</p>

<p>
"Why, man alive, I ate it!"
</p>

<p>
"You eatee he alive, sah?" cried Cassia-bud.
</p>

<p>
"No, Kash, I had it cooked; and it was the most
delightfully tasty and toothsome morsel ever I put
inside my lips.  Another was caught next day, and lots
more after; and I grew better from that very night,
and so that also was a disappointed shark."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! yum! yum!" said Quambo, "dey is good
food.  I likee some now.  Yum!"
</p>

<p>
"What, flying-fish, Quambo?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, sah, de shark!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Quambo," said Fred, "you can catch some for
yourself, only you'll have to dine all alone when you
have shark for dinner."
</p>

<p>
"When I a leetle boy," said Quambo thoughtfully,
"I catchee plenty big shark&mdash;I and some oder
nigger-boy, and two, tree, four nigger-men."
</p>

<p>
"Now for Quambo's story," cried Frank.  "Heave
round with your yarn, Quambo, lad."
</p>

<p>
"I lib along o' my ole mudder in Africa befo' I go to
de States.  On de Gold Coast dat were, gen'lem.
Shark plenty value dere.  Good fo' food and good for
de skin, wot we cure and de white man buy.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty reef on dat coast, gen'lem.  Well, we go
close to de reef, all same's we were de night de big
black head jump ober and swamp de boat.  We go
close to de reef.  Den we hab one long strong rope wid
a runnin' noose on de end o' he for to catchee de
shark."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Quambo; but tell us the modus operandi."
</p>

<p>
"What ship's dat, sah?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean, how did you catch the beggars, Quambo?"
</p>

<p>
"Bery easy, sah, indeed.  You see de sharks mos'ly
goes to sleep in de middle ob de day.  Dey creep into
de coral caves.  All de same, sah, de tail all lef stickin'
out ob de holes, you see."
</p>

<p>
"And do you mean to tell us, Quambo, that you
went and pulled their tails?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite, sah Quambo not quite so big a fool as
dat.  But I myse'f and two more tiny boys go dive
down, and plenty quick Quambo slip de noose ober a
tail, den signal.  De noose he tighten now, and de
shark is pull right out and lift up all de way to de
boat.  How dat shark do squirm to be sure!  When
de man in de boat hab kill he propah, den down
Quambo go again."*
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* This is no sailor's yarn.  This terrible mode
of catching sharks is
really adopted in the South Sea islands and elsewhere.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Well, Quambo, that is very awful, if true."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he true, sah!  I gib my word of honah on dat, sah."
</p>

<p>
"But, Quambo, did the sharks never retaliate?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sah, de shark 'taliate my leetle brudder, sah.
I see my brudder try to make fast to one bery big tail.
He not can do.  Den de owner of dat big tail come
out plenty quick.  I dive up, sah."
</p>

<p>
"An' your brother, Quambo?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I guess, sah, he dive down.  I hab no mo'
leetle brudder after dat.  I spose he 'taliated."
</p>

<p class="thought">

</p>

<p>
But flying fish were very plentiful round the island,
and I think Cassia-bud must have lain awake a whole
night trying to find out a plan to get some.  He was
completely successful.  A kind of big butterfly neb
was manufactured by Quambo and him.  This was
part of the flying-fish tackle, but not all.  It is a
well-known fact that flying fish will come towards a light
held near the surface of the sea at night.  Now it
only remained to manufacture a torch, and Quambo
came to the rescue.
</p>

<p>
In the South Sea islands one of the most lovely trees
that grows in the forest is the Dooee-Dooee or
Candle-mat tree.  The broad silvery-green leaves, and the
bunches of charmingly white and shapely flowers,
render it an object of great beauty, especially if it
stands near other trees of a darker green.  The nuts
that grow on this tree are heated, then cracked to get
the kernel out.  These kernels are strung together like
beads, and the strings of kernels tied round with bark,
and lo! the candle is complete.
</p>

<p>
So Quambo and Cassia-bud started out together one
night, and splendid sport they had, and just as splendid
a breakfast next day; for nothing could exceed in
flavour the flesh of those flying fish.
</p>

<p>
But as often as not now Fred and Frank used to go
after the flying fish together.
</p>

<p>
One night Quambo happened to be in the boat, and
it was well he was, else an adventure that befel our
heroes would, in all probability, have had a sad
termination.  On this particular evening flying fish
were very numerous; and while rowing on a spurt
after a shoal, suddenly the boat seemed to strike a
rock, with such violence too as to throw both Fred and
Frank over the thwarts.  It was no rock, however; for
immediately after the boat was shaken with terrible
violence, and several times all but capsized.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, Quambo was equal to the occasion.  He was
forward in the bows, and lancing and lunging at the
enemy&mdash;an immense sword-fish&mdash;almost before our
heroes had time to gather themselves up.  Suddenly
the boat was pulled almost under water by the head;
then there was a dull report, and she was free from
the monster, and slowly righted herself once more.
</p>

<p>
She was now making water so fast that it was
deemed prudent to get on shore with all speed.  So
her head was turned towards the gap in the reef.
Quambo kept bailing all the time, and Fred and
Frank rowed as they had never rowed before.  They
got her run up at last on the sandy beach; but it
took all hands three whole days to make good repairs,
for it must be remembered they had no tools worthy
of mention to work with.
</p>

<p>
Little did they imagine, however, that they would
soon be possessed of tools enough and to spare.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br><br>
"WHAT WAS THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THAT STRANGE VESSEL?"
</h3>

<p>
In the isle of Good Hope clumps of fine cocoa-nut-trees
grew close to the sandy beach, and
single, very large, pandanus, trees not far off.
This pandanus or screw pine I have already
mentioned; it is a truly marvellous tree, and
bears truly marvellous fruit or drupes.  This
fruit is treated in various ways, and after a time a taste
for it is acquired, so that it becomes quite an article
of diet, and is relished even more than cocoanut; for
this soon palls on one.  But even the flowers of this
tree are edible, at least Quambo and Cassia-bud found
them palatable enough, though the others much preferred
their perfume.  Quite a quantity of the leaves
of the pandanus were cut down to be used as thatch for
the huts.  They are long, strong, and tough, and being
fastened on with string make very excellent thatch
indeed.
</p>

<p>
It is in connection with this tree that I have now to
relate an adventure, which it will be owned was of a
very startling character indeed.
</p>

<p>
About two hundred yards from the camp, and about
seventy from the beach, grew a clump or grove of
pandanus.  Some of the trees therein were very tall and
spreading, and in addition to their aerial roots had let
down props or stays from the upper branches to help
them to sustain the weight of the branches.  It was up
these prop-roots that Quambo or Cassia-bud used to
shin to cut down leaves or flowers.
</p>

<p>
It was the custom of Fred and Frank, of an evening
after dinner, to take a walk back and fore on the sand,
and they were usually accompanied by Cassia-bud and
his friend Hurricane Bob.
</p>

<p>
One evening while strolling quietly in the clear
starlight towards the pandanus grove they were surprised to
see the great dog suddenly pause, and pointing towards
the dark trees utter a low and ominous growl; but
they were still more astonished, and not a little
frightened, to note almost immediately after what
appeared to be the form of a gigantic man stalk from
out the shadow, and walk with a curious rolling
shambling gait towards the sea.  About half-way
down he stopped, standing out clear against the
snow-white sands, and fiercely waved his long arms in the
air, but made no sound.
</p>

<p>
A more awful apparition it would be difficult even
to imagine.  Cassia-bud dropped half dead with fear
on the sand, uttering only a sound that was half cry,
half moan, as from one in a nightmare.  Both Fred and
Frank experienced a fearful kind of impulse to rush
towards the terrible being, but next moment it dashed
on towards the sea, into which it threw itself with a
loud splash.
</p>

<p>
"In the name of heaven," cried Frank, "who or
what was that?"
</p>

<p>
"Some dreadful mystery," replied Fred, "that I
cannot solve.  Come," he added, "you are superstitious,
Frank."
</p>

<p>
"I am, for once in a way, Fred.  If that wasn't an
evil spirit, then no such being exists in the world,
What did it seem to you like?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you know the awful water fiend or kelpie,
that is supposed to haunt deep, dark mountain lochs in
the Scottish Highlands, and often, they say, carries
away children and women to devour at the bottom of
the lake.  He is a hideous, tall figure, but with wings
like a bat, that stretch 'twixt arms and legs.  Frank,
we have seen a water kelpie!"
</p>

<p>
"May the Lord be near us, Fred.  I never felt so
frightened in all my life."
</p>

<p>
They went slowly back to camp, giving many a
furtive glance behind, for more than once they thought
they could hear the sound of footsteps stealing softly
up behind them.
</p>

<p>
They slept in their green tent that night, making a
big fire up near the mouth of it, and more than once
Cassia-bud started and screamed in his sleep.
</p>

<p>
But they were not molested, and the sun was shining
very brightly indeed when they awoke, and Quambo
proceeded to cook breakfast.
</p>

<p>
The first thing Fred and Frank did after their
morning meal was to walk, somewhat fearfully it must
be confessed, towards the pandanus grove.
</p>

<p>
They half expected to see human foot-prints in the
sand.  There was a trail across the beach, but no
impression of feet of any kind, and this fact deepened
the mystery that hung around the dread apparition.
</p>

<p>
That day Quambo ascended a pandanus tree to throw
down leaves and flowers.  These last are of a yellow
or lemon colour, and look sweetly pretty against the
dark-green of the long, screw-like leaves.
</p>

<p>
Quambo busied himself culling flowers for some
time, then he hailed those below sailor-fashion.
</p>

<p>
"On deck dere, gen'lems!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, lad," cried Fred.
</p>

<p>
"Somebody else been heah las' night sah, gaddering
flowers foh true."
</p>

<p>
"Who? what, Quambo?"
</p>

<p>
"Dunno, sah; surely de debil himse'f, sah."
</p>

<p>
That night all hands went along the beach and
waited quite a long time, but the kelpie failed to put
in an appearance.
</p>

<p>
Next evening it was suggested they should hide in
the bush&mdash;not certainly in the grove itself.  So here
once again they waited and watched.
</p>

<p>
Nothing came out of the sea; but before they had
been in hiding for half an hour they heard noises in
the trees that convinced them the creature was there.
Almost at the same time the dog barked loud and
angrily, and something dropped with a dull, heavy
thud to the ground.
</p>

<p>
As if by one impulse, but with Quambo firmly
holding the dog by his collar, lest he might force the
fighting with the awful unknown, they dashed forward.
The creature could be distinctly seen against the
background of sand, and strange to say it assumed
various shapes, and moved but slowly away, as if in
anger.  At one moment it was the tall, dark kelpie-like
monster waving its arms in the air, next it took the
appearance of a huge frog, and immediately after rolled
seaward in the form of a gigantic wheel.  There was
the same splashing noise when it took the water as
before, and though they sat on the beach for a fall
hour after this it made no further signs.
</p>

<p>
The kelpie, as Fred persisted in calling it, appeared
many times after this, always coming from the pandanus
grove, and it was not until one bright and radiant
moonlight night that our heroes found out what it
actually was.
</p>

<p>
They had been out after flying-fish, Quambo being
in the boat, when it occurred to them to land near the
grove.  The boat was pulled cautiously near to the
beach, and while Fred and Frank lay on their oars the
giant negro stood forward in the bows with his terrible
lance.
</p>

<p>
"Stand by," shouted Fred shortly after, "yonder is
the kelpie.  It is coming straight for us!"
</p>

<p>
So it did, and the boat was beached almost on
the creature, which had come rolling like a wheel
towards it.
</p>

<p>
A triple attack was made on it; Fred and Frank
with oars, the huge negro with his lance, while armed
with another spear Magilvray rushed along the beach
and attacked it from the rear.
</p>

<p>
But the oars were seized and twisted in our heroes'
hands, even the gunwale of the boat was grasped by
those awful arms.
</p>

<p>
They knew now, however, what they were fighting
with.  It was no fiend or kelpie, but a huge specimen
of the gigantic octopus, kraken, or devil-fish of southern
seas.
</p>

<p>
It was literally hacked to pieces before it could be
killed.
</p>

<p>
Lying on the beach there next day, with its mangled
body, awful face, and snake-like arms, it had really a
terrible appearance, and reminded Fred of some of the
pictures of Dor√©'s monsters in Dante's Inferno.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The castaways had now been over six months on
this lonely island, and all that time had never seen a
ship or sail of any kind.
</p>

<p>
How much longer they were to remain prisoners no
one, of course, could even guess.
</p>

<p>
"Surely," they thought, "some day some ship must
come."
</p>

<p>
Yes; and one day a ship did come,
</p>

<p>
Summer and autumn had ended.  It was winter
now, if the name can possibly be applied to such a
climate as this.  The time was June anyhow, which is
midwinter in these regions, and it was the season of
clouds and storms and dense fogs at times.
</p>

<p>
They had fully prepared for it, however, having
greatly strengthened their hut, and thatched it round
and round with pandanus leaves and cocoanut fibre.
</p>

<p>
The coneys or cavies had been very abundant of
late, and the skins were stretched, salted, and dried.
They might come in handy by-and-by to make articles
of dress.
</p>

<p>
One day all hands had gone to the Beacon Hill for
the purpose of repairing the broom, which had got
nearly blown away.
</p>

<p>
They had been working very hard and earnestly, and
had seldom looked about them, but having finished the
work, they sat merrily down to eat their well-earned
luncheon.
</p>

<p>
Quambo and Mac were lighting their pipes afterwards,
and Fred was scanning the ocean with his glass.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank!" he cried suddenly.  "A ship! a ship!"
</p>

<p>
"A ship!  Oh, you don't say so!"
</p>

<p>
Every eye was strained towards a little dark dot
that appeared far away on the sea's deep blue.  She
must have been twenty miles to the south when first
seen, and all that afternoon they watched her creeping
ever so slowly nearer, and still more near, but at sunset
she was at least ten miles off, as near as could be
judged.
</p>

<p>
She was becalmed, and only moving with the ocean's
current.  But never a stitch of canvas could be
descried on her when the great red sun went down,
and night and darkness fell.
</p>

<p>
What was the mystery surrounding that strange
vessel?  It seemed inexplicable.  However, they would
have to wait for another day seemingly, before it could
be revealed.
</p>

<p>
Slowly down the hill they went, and by many a
devious path through forest and glen, till they stood
once more beside their tent.
</p>

<p>
So anxious were they that hardly an eye was closed
in sleep that night, and long before the stars had paled
before the coming day they were <i>en route</i> for Beacon
Hill.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap27"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br><br>
FRANK GAZED AGHAST.
</h3>

<p>
The sun had already risen when the party once
more found themselves by the beacon.  Frank
gazed aghast almost; for almost close to the
southern beach of the island, and evidently
running ashore, was a strangely dismantled
old brig.  It was the <i>Resolute</i>.
</p>

<p>
Her sails hung in tatters from the yards, her
jibboom and foretopgallant mast had been carried
away as if she had been in collision, and there was not
a sign of life to be seen anywhere about her decks.
She was drifting almost broadside on towards the
shore, on which, long before they could possibly reach
her, it was evident enough she would dash like a heap
of drift wood.  There was, however, no sea on, and
until it came on to blow she might lie quietly enough.
</p>

<p>
No time was now lost in getting back to camp and
taking the boat out.
</p>

<p>
Hardly anyone spoke a word as they rowed out
through the gap, round the point, and bore up towards
the brig.  They were willing to wait to find some
solution of the seeming mystery of her arrival, rather
than to hazard guesses concerning it.
</p>

<p>
Yes, she had grounded, but not broadside on to the
beach, as they all thought she would.  The send of the
tide had caught her stern and brought her round, and
she lay on the soft sandy bottom&mdash;bows on to the
shore.
</p>

<p>
Evidently she was half full of water, else she would
have drifted farther in.
</p>

<p>
It was by no means difficult to scramble on board,
therefore, despite the fact that her iron works were a
mass of rust, and her bulwarks green and slimy.  So
too were the decks.  She lay with a slight list to port,
and our heroes, who had boarded at that side, found it
somewhat difficult to reach the companion, so slippery
were her decks.
</p>

<p>
Before going below they stood for a few minutes to
gaze about them.
</p>

<p>
Dilapidation everywhere!  She looked as a ship that
has been long sunk beneath the salt seas would appear,
if suddenly raised again.
</p>

<p>
Frank and Fred exchanged glances.
</p>

<p>
"How do you feel, Fred?"
</p>

<p>
"I feel," was the reply, "like one who stands on the
confines of another world.  Oh, mercy on us, Frank!
where has this ship been during these long six months
and over, and where is her unhappy crew?"
</p>

<p>
"They must have left her, Fred.  See, there isn't a
single boat visible, and the iron davits are slued round
towards the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is evident, Frank, she is a derelict.  And
the probability is she had run on shore on some reef
after being deserted, and has lain there ever since till
floated by an extra high tide.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Fred, it's all a puzzle to me; but I'd give a
good deal to know where the skipper and the crew
are.  Come below."
</p>

<p>
The ship had been partially battened down, making
it evident that she had been deserted soon after, or
even during, a gale of wind, the crew believing she was
settling down.
</p>

<p>
Before going below they proceeded to open the
hatches in order to let both light and air between
decks.  They had just passed the fore hatch, when
their nostrils were assailed by a foul and awful odour
proceeding from the galley.
</p>

<p>
"There's something wrong here, sir," said Magilvray.
</p>

<p>
"Mac," said Fred, "will you venture down?"
</p>

<p>
"That I will, sir."
</p>

<p>
Presently he re-appeared.  He was looking scared
and amazed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir," he cried, "there be two skeletons yonder
in irons, sir!  I mean what I say," he added, in reply
to the looks of astonishment depicted on Fred's face
and Frank's.  "And what is more, sir, they're the
self-same chaps as we picked up afore we found the
<i>Resolute</i> in the southern sea of ice."
</p>

<p>
"This is awful," said Fred.  "Frank, will you come
below?
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Fred."
</p>

<p>
Down the fore ladder they went.
</p>

<p>
It was a horrible sight their eyes alighted on.  For
a few moments the semi-darkness dazed them; but
soon every detail became distinct enough.  Both corpses
lay on their backs, their skeleton legs still encompassed
by the iron staples that bound them to a long strong
bar of steel.  Only by their clothes, and by a ring on
the finger of one, could they have been distinguished.
The old place was alive with gigantic cockroaches,
and loathsome centipedes crept about the skulls of the
skeletons, and disappeared to hide in their eye sockets,
while rats, tame from starvation, crawled here and there
on the deck.  It was evident enough that the wretched
men had been guilty of some crime that had necessitated
their being put in irons, and that they had been entirely
forgotten during the hurry and scurry of lowering the
boats and leaving the ship.  And so&mdash;awful fate!&mdash;they
must have slowly starved and died.  Probably
been partly eaten alive by the rats, with which Frank
said the ship had always abounded.
</p>

<p>
The young men were glad indeed when they found
themselves once more on deck under the blue sky,
and breathing the sweet pure air of heaven.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't be sorry," said Frank, "when we get on
shore out of this awful charnel-house of a ship.  I hope
there is nothing dreadful to see in the saloon."
</p>

<p>
Thither they now bent their steps, and descended
the slimy ladder.
</p>

<p>
There was everywhere below the same evidence of
hurried desertion.  The store-room door was open,
boxes and small casks had been partially hauled out,
and left where they stood.  The compass that usually
hangs under the skylight had been taken down, but
left on the table beside the chronometer.  In the
captain's stateroom the bedclothes in the bunk were in
disorder, and on a table near stood propped up a
half-empty bottle of rum.
</p>

<p>
The ship's log lay on the saloon floor, and a glance at
it showed that the last entry had been made on the
very day our castaways had left the <i>San Salvador</i> for
the mirage island.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad," said Frank, "there are no more corpses
here."
</p>

<p>
"So am I; but now, Frank, it is a duty we owe ourselves
to save all we can out of this derelict vessel, that
Providence has guided to the shores of our island."
</p>

<p>
"By the looks o' the horizon, sir," said Mac, "it won't
be long afore we has a storm."
</p>

<p>
"In that case, Mac, we ought to begin work at once."
</p>

<p>
So a consultation was hurriedly held as to what
should first be saved.
</p>

<p>
There were plenty of rifles on board and ammunition,
and there were also carpenters' tools of all sorts.  These
to the castaways were by far and away the most valuable
portions of the brig's cargo.  So without any unnecessary
delay these were got up and safely landed on the
beach.  None too soon, however, for already a heavy
swell was rolling in from the south and lifting and
bumping the after part of the vessel.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of some tinned meats and soup
the provisions on board were found to be utterly
worthless; but Quambo's eyes brightened, and so did
Mac's, when they came across the tobacco cask.  That
was saved.  There was rum in abundance, but no
one evinced the slightest inclination to take a single
bottle on shore.  Books, the compass, and the
chronometer were the last things to be taken away.
</p>

<p>
But the breakers were now roaring and thundering
on the beach, and so it was deemed unsafe to go off to
the derelict any more that day.  Instead therefore of
returning to their camp they built themselves a tent
under the trees with spars and canvas taken from the
vessel, and prepared to pass the night here, so as to be
ready to begin work early next day again.
</p>

<p>
It was a very dark night, for the sky had become
overcast with heavy clouds, and the wind was beginning
to moan through the trees with a sound that betokened
a coming storm.  But dinner had put everyone in good
temper, and luxuries to-night had been enjoyed that
they had never expected to taste again.  Besides, they
had a lamp to burn and books to read.  What more
could any castaway desire?
</p>

<p>
They had saved also two chests of clothing, and
would therefore be quite independent of cavies' skins
for many a day to come, or, as Frank said, until the
real living ship arrived with living beings on it instead
of corpses, and took them away back to their far-off
home beyond the seas.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid that long before dinner was discussed
that evening, they had forgotten all about the terrible
fate of the poor wretches who had been left chained up
in the derelict to be eaten alive by rats.  They were all
very happy and very hopeful too to-night.  A ship
was sure to come some day, and a few months more or
less on this island could not signify a great deal.
</p>

<p>
"Give us a song," cried Frank.
</p>

<p>
And it was not one song they sang, but half a
dozen at least; and then they lay around the lamp
and talked of home and old, old times.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was just about this time, if they had only known
it, that Captain Cawdor, after landing Se√±or Sarpinto
at San Francisco, had left his ship, and crossing to New
York, had taken the mail for Liverpool.
</p>

<p>
He went thence to Glasgow, and after meeting and
reporting himself to his brother shipowners, and telling
them of all his adventures and doings, he set out for
Methlin, to break the sad news to Fred's people.
</p>

<p>
What a lovely summer's-day it was when Captain
Cawdor, on board the cutter he had hired, sailed slowly
into Methlin Bay.
</p>

<p>
How blue the hills looked, asleep under the cerulean
sky; how sweetly green the birchen trees; how peaceful
the village, with the wee, white, brown-thatched
cottages.  And he, this truly good and kind old sailor,
had come to bring grief to all it contained.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he thought, "if I could only give them even
an atom of hope!  But, alas!  I cannot."
</p>

<p>
Eean was glad to see him.  They had met before;
but a glance told the old fisherman and his wife that
the white-haired sailor was the bearer of bad tidings.
</p>

<p>
Long, long after Toddie&mdash;from whom the sad news
was withheld&mdash;had gone to bed and was fast asleep,
the old people sat beside the fire, and it is needless to
say what the subject of their conversation was.  But
though Eppie's eyes were red with weeping, and she
had even forgotten her spinning-wheel, neither she nor
Eean were entirely hopeless.
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Eean, "something tells me my boy
still lives.  He is somewhere in those seas; and though
I am willing to submit to the will of our heavenly
Father, I believe that he will yet return.
</p>

<p>
"And tell me now, Captain Cawdor, all about this
Se√±or Sarpinto.  Do you know, captain, I'm strangely
interested in this man.  And what is more, his very
name seems familiar to me.  But where I have met
him, or how or when, is to me a mystery.  I must
dream over it, and&mdash;yes, and pray over it.  Yet
somehow I think Sarpinto is mixed up in our history."
</p>

<p>
Then Captain Cawdor told them all he knew.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Why, Fred," said Frank, "the wind is rising!  Listen!"
</p>

<p>
The wind was undoubtedly getting up.  The canvas
of the rude tent began to flap, and mingled with the
boom of the breakers on the shore came the steadier
roar of the breeze in the trees overhead.
</p>

<p>
In these regions storms come on at times with
terrible suddenness, and rage with wondrous force.
And this occasion proved no exception.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour after the wind had commenced to
moan through the leaves of the pandanus forest, the
storm was at its height, accompanied by such terrible
thunder and such vivid lightning as none of our castaways
had ever experienced before.  Anon the rain came
down in torrents, but the wind lost none of its force.
</p>

<p>
All that night the hurricane raged, and for the first
time since they had come to the island our heroes knew
what it was to feel cold.  They were wet too, as well
as cold, for the frail impromptu tent proved but a poor
protection against the violence of so awful a storm.
</p>

<p>
Towards the earlier hours, despite the incessant noise,
all must have slept, and it was broad daylight before
they again awoke.
</p>

<p>
Fred sat up rubbing his eyes, and for a time
wondering where he was.  Then all the strange events
of the previous day rushed back to his mind, and he
got up and staggered out.
</p>

<p>
The wind still blew high, but it was evidently dying
down.
</p>

<p>
But where was the brig <i>Resolute</i>?  Was she gone
again, or had it all been a dream?
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap28"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br><br>
COULD HE BE&mdash;&mdash;DEAD?
</h3>

<p>
Gone the <i>Resolute</i> most assuredly was.
Hardly a timber of the old craft was left
together, only a portion of the hull and
some dark skeleton ribs pointing skywards
through the white chaos of surf that boiled
and swirled around them.
</p>

<p>
And the beach on both sides was strewed with
wreckage.
</p>

<p>
"Frank," said Fred that same morning:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I had a dream, a happy dream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamt that I was free;<br>
  That in a boat that we had built<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sailed across the sea."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Bravo!" cried Frank, "I didn't know you were a
born poet.  Pass the sardines and the pickles, like a
good boy.  Fancy eating sardines in this world again.
But, I say, you know, touching that dream, it is a real
jolly one, and as soon as I've time I'll think it out
Why shouldn't we, now that we have tools, commence
to build a ship?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why we shouldn't really.  But mind
you it isn't quite such a simple business as you may
imagine.  She would require to be a biggish boat, you
know, and there are two difficulties to be thought out
at the very commencement.
</p>

<p>
"First and foremost, Fred, if we are going to build
her close to the beach, we may reckon on getting our
work all destroyed in the first gale of wind that blows;
secondly, if we build her a safe distance from the sea,
how are we to launch her?"
</p>

<p>
So no more was said about building a ship just then,
but, nevertheless, the idea had taken root in the minds
of all hands, and even Hurricane Bob pretended to look
very wise when Cassia-bud broached the subject to him.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It took our castaways three whole days to get their
stores round to the place where the camp was, as they
were mostly all removed by sea.  But the planks of
the wreck that they thought might one day come in
handy were dragged off the beach, and piled in a heap
far beyond the reach of the water.
</p>

<p>
While engaged at this work they suddenly came
face to face with those awful brothers in death, the
ironed skeletons.  They were sitting on the beach,
having evidently been floated out of the wreck on a
piece of the deck.  Sitting there bolt upright, their
sightless eye-sockets turned towards the sea, the arm
of one of them slightly raised, the fleshless fingers
pointing towards the distant horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Why this is awful!" said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Fred, "and it seems to me those spectres
will haunt us unless we bury them out of sight."
</p>

<p>
It was determined to do so at once therefore, and
Magilvray and Fred set about digging a grave high up
on the beach.
</p>

<p>
"Poor wretches," said Frank.  "Suppose, Fred, we
read the English burial service over them.  They had
sinned, but oh, they have suffered!  Shall we?"
</p>

<p>
"You're a right good fellow, Frank.  Yes."
</p>

<p>
Among the books brought on shore was a church
service, and Frank, being more English than Fred, in
a solemn voice read the service.  The bodies were then
lowered into the grave and covered up.
</p>

<p>
Some weeks after this they raised a cross above the
spot where they lay, and carved the names of the
unfortunate sailors on it.
</p>

<p>
"Those wretches may have had friends and relations
in America, who may be even now waiting and
waiting, and hoping and hoping, for their return.  Who
knows?"
</p>

<p>
That is what Fred said, as in company with his
friend he left the lonesome grave to return to camp.
</p>

<p>
For two months after the destruction of the derelict
the weather continued unsettled and heavy.  A deal
of rain fell occasionally, and there were at times
storms of wind that appeared to shake the island to
its very foundations.
</p>

<p>
One evening, on their return from the woods, where
they had been cavy shooting, Frank seemed quieter
and duller than usual.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, old man?  You don't appear to
be your own saucy self to-night at all."
</p>

<p>
Fred laughed a kind of a ready-made laugh.
</p>

<p>
"No, strangely enough," he said, "I feel dull in
spirits.  I don't know if I am looking old, but I really
feel to be about ninety-three or ninety-four."
</p>

<p>
"It's best to be exact, old man," said Fred, "but a
good dinner will set you as straight as a plummet."
</p>

<p>
The good dinner was all ready, but it did not set
Frank straight.
</p>

<p>
He lay down soon after, and Fred really for once
felt sorry that his bed was one of green boughs.  He
sat till nearly morning beside his friend, who was now
in a high and raging fever.
</p>

<p>
From the very first Frank's illness assumed a vigorous
type.  He was quite delirious.  Sometimes, indeed, it
took all Quambo's force to keep him still.  He raved
too, talking constantly of home and of his mother,
and even of his dead and gone father.  Or at one
moment he seemed to be far away among the stormy
seas of Antarctic regions, and the next sailing in the
little yacht <i>Water Baby</i>, with Toddie and Fred, on
the wild and beautiful coast around Methlin.
</p>

<p>
For a whole week he continued thus, being nursed
and watched constantly by Fred and the others.  Then
he became quieter, and his friend feared weaker also.
His ravings now were far less wild.  It almost broke
Fred's heart to hear him talking so constantly about
his mother and Toddie.  It was always mother now
or Toddie.
</p>

<p>
He grew weaker and weaker, in spite of all they
could do for him.
</p>

<p>
But he knew those around him now, and was very
seldom delirious.  When he did sink into a moment's
raving lethargy, he would keep repeating over and
over again the words, "I'm going home; oh, I want
so much to go home!"
</p>

<p>
One evening, while seated beside him, Fred thought
he could see the hand of death busy on his face; then
he broke down entirely, and sat sobbing and weeping
beside Frank's couch of boughs, as if surely his heart
would break.
</p>

<p>
Frank awoke, and seeing Fred crying, stretched out
his hand to him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't cry, poor Fred," he said, "We're brothers yet."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," said Fred, "brothers ever."
</p>

<p>
"Brothers till death," Frank muttered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Frank, Frank, do not talk thus!  I will not, I
cannot let you go!"
</p>

<p>
It did seem, nevertheless, that poor Frank was going
home that night.
</p>

<p>
The scene in that tent of boughs was a strange but
a solemn one; the sick lad&mdash;he was not yet twenty
years of age&mdash;lying on the couch in the corner, with
sad-faced Fred holding his hand as he squatted near
him, little Cassia-bud sitting dolefully by the door,
Quambo towering high above him, and the great dog,
as sad as anyone, lying on the floor watching all.  The
lamp gave but a feeble light, for it was shaded by
green branches; and this only added additional gloom
to everything around.
</p>

<p>
"Are you there, Fred?"
</p>

<p>
It was Frank's voice, though it sounded very weak
and very far away.
</p>

<p>
"I'm by you, dear Frank."
</p>

<p>
"Isn't it very dark?"
</p>

<p>
Fred's heart gave an uneasy thud.  Had he
attempted to speak now the tears would have choked
him.  Frank was dying, he thought.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to sleep, Fred.  Good night.  Hold my
hand."
</p>

<p>
There was not a hush now in the tent.  Fred kept
his friend's thin hand in his, his eyes on his face.
</p>

<p>
Fred was praying; and praying perhaps with greater
earnestness than ever he had prayed before.  Oh, if
his heavenly Father, who had saved them from so
many a danger, that loving tender Father, who
heareth in secret, and to whom all the ends of the earth
are well known, would but deign to hear him now, and
spare his friend even at the eleventh hour!
</p>

<p>
How quietly Frank was breathing!  How very still
he lay!  Could he be&mdash;<i>dead</i>?
</p>

<p>
Fred put his ear down to listen.  Yes, he could hear
his gentle breathing.  This was not death, it was
sleep&mdash;gentle sleep.
</p>

<p>
Never once did Fred move from his position all
that livelong night; and when the sun rose and cast
the shadows of the mountains across the placid bay,
the lad was still at his post.
</p>

<p>
At length Frank opened his eyes, and seeing Fred,
gently pressed his hand and smiled.
</p>

<p>
The sleep had done its kindest work.
</p>

<p>
Just a little cocoanut water, so cool and refreshing,
then, like a baby, Frank dropped off again; and Fred
went right away into the bush all by himself, and
kneeling down beside a pandanus tree, returned thanks
to Him who had heard his prayer.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Slow indeed, but steadfast, was Frank's recovery now
from his terrible illness.  For weeks he scarce could
walk; but now in the matter of cookery Quambo quite
excelled even himself.  With the aid of herbs he
concocted the most delicious cavy stews; he wrapped
flying fish in fragrant leaves, and did them over a clear
fire, and he even concocted strengthening broths, from
birds they shot in the woods.
</p>

<p>
But Cassia-bud went wandering all by himself round
the island one day, and, lo and behold! he found a bed
of clams near the shore.  The clams proved an unexpected
delicacy to all, but more especially to Frank.  Turtles'
eggs, also discovered by Cassia-bud, completed the cure.
</p>

<p>
And so Frank grew strong again once more, and
happiness and joy reigned again in the little camp by
the sea.  And now, not knowing how much longer they
should have to live on this unknown island, Fred planned
the building of a house and laying out of a garden; for
though a tent of boughs is all very well in times of
health, it is wanting in comfort when sickness comes.
</p>

<p>
For weeks the four men&mdash;note, I have come to call
them men at last&mdash;the four men laboured hard in
effecting a clearing, while the catering and cooking
devolved entirely upon little Cassia-bud and Bob.  Not
that Bob did much, but he often caught a cavy, and
besides he was such a companion to Cassia-bud, it is
doubtful if the lad could have got on at all without him.
For gardening tools our castaways were worst off,
but they managed to manufacture spades of a rough
sort from the wood of the pandanus tree.
</p>

<p>
So the work of clearing and digging went merrily on,
and the exercise it evolved strengthened every muscle
in their bodies, and caused them to feel as happy as the
birds that sang in the boughs.
</p>

<p>
All round the garden they wove a snake fence, and
hung gates; but the fence was more for show than
utility, as there really was nothing to protect themselves
from; all their enemies lived in the water, and, with
the exception of robber-crabs, and an occasional octopus,
never came on shore.
</p>

<p>
Trees were now sawn into planks, and exposed to
dry, by being piled up so that the warm air could blow
over them.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-four feet long by twelve wide, that was the
size they measured out for their cottage; and it would
be seven feet high at the eaves, and consist of two
rooms.  So they proceeded at once to plant or put down
the uprights and strong cross-beams to support the
roof.  For these purposes many of the planks saved
from the wreck of the <i>Resolute</i> came in very handy.
The uprights were firmly fixed in the ground, and the
cross-beams fastened with hard wooden pegs on top of
these.
</p>

<p>
The plan they adopted for boring holes was certainly
original and expeditious also.  Quambo had proposed
to burn holes in the planks.
</p>

<p>
"No," said Fred, "I know a quicker plan."
</p>

<p>
"You do, sah!"
</p>

<p>
"Now make a mark at the very place you want a
hole drilled."
</p>

<p>
Quambo did as he was told.  Fred picked up a loaded
rifle, and in less than a second the hole was made.
</p>

<p>
Quambo laughed at this till the woods rang again,
and Bob ran off to the woods expecting that there must
be game of some kind to retrieve.
</p>

<p>
The making of doors and shutters for the openings
that had to do duty as windows required considerable
time, and an expenditure of skill also; but these were
finished at last.  Instead of being hinged on, they were
made to slide backwards and forwards, and this also
was Fred's idea.
</p>

<p>
There were no fire places, but ventilators; for it
would be always best to do all the cooking out of doors.
</p>

<p>
At long last the cottage was finished, and when the
slanting roof was thatched with leaves of the
pandanus&mdash;some of these being six feet in length&mdash;very neat
and wholly rustic it looked.
</p>

<p>
Table and seats were next made.  These were rough
enough in all conscience, but they suited very well indeed.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Frank, "the front of the cottage
looks rather plain and squatter-like."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Fred, "let us build a porch, and plant
wild climbing flowers from the forest around it."
</p>

<p>
So this was done.
</p>

<p>
The castaways now turned their attention to the
garden.  Walks were laid out and bordered with old
plank, and covered thickly over with silver sand from
the beach.  Then flowers and flowering shrubs were
planted, and when all was finished proud indeed were
they of their charming cottage and grounds.  Even
the snake fence they had run up round the compound
sprouted and grew rapidly, so it was partly hedge and
partly railing.
</p>

<p>
There was no occasion to plant vegetables in the
garden, for everything they wanted grew wild in the
woods, including many kinds of spices and turmeric
also, from which Quambo, after they settled down again,
concocted many a fragrant and delicious curry.
</p>

<p>
Well now, on the whole, our castaways were not badly
off.  They owned a house and grounds, they owned a boat,
they had rifles and ammunition, and no lack of food.
</p>

<p>
All they longed for was the sight of a ship.
</p>

<p>
But the climate in which they lived is not only
healthful and balmy, but calmative as well, so they did
not pine so much as might have been expected.
</p>

<p>
"I say," said Fred one evening, "to-morrow will
complete our first year on this island.
</p>

<p>
"How the time has fled!" said Frank.  "I couldn't
have believed it."
</p>

<p>
So they celebrated their advent-day by having quite
a banquet in their new-built cottage, and everyone
admitted&mdash;including Hurricane Bob&mdash;that Quambo
had never spread before them such a dinner as this,
such fragrant curry, nor such delightfully cooked fish.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was early summer in the woods now; early summer
with the trees, with their gorgeous and glittering
foliage, and their wealth of flowers&mdash;snow-white, yellow,
lemon, and crimson; early summer with the forest birds,
whose sweet low songs filled every grove and glen; early
summer with the wild bees, the gorgeous beetles, and
still more lovely butterflies; early summer with many
species of seafaring birds as well, who built on the
rocks and cliffs&mdash;gulls and noddies, and the swift-winged
frigate bird; early summer on land and on sea,
which shimmered in the sunshine like polished steel.
</p>

<p>
It was well that our castaways had saved tinned
meats from the wreck; for among the cavies or coneys
it was thought advisable now to institute a kind of
close season.  It was breeding time, and to slay the
parents, leaving perhaps the young to starve to death,
would have been cruel in the extreme.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX.
<br><br>
THE ARRIVAL OF SAVAGES.
</h3>

<p>
It soon became evident that the supply of
petroleum oil saved from the brig would run
short, but here again Quambo came to the
rescue.  He and Cassia-bud collected an
immense heap of ripe cocoa-nuts, and every
day for weeks were busy doing something or
other to them.  I think they wished them to decay.
At all events at the end of that time they set to
pounding them up by degrees, and gradually extracted
from the mess quite a large quantity of clear and
beautiful oil.  This in a less warm country would have
been solid.  The lamps in which the oil was burned
were simply cocoa-nut shells cut down.  A little water
was put in first, then the oil over this, and wicks of
pith floated on top by inserting them in disks of wood.
So the difficulty of light was got over.  And this was
certainly something to be thankful for, because the
sun set every night soon after six o'clock, and to have
had to sit for long hours in the dark before turning in,
would have been anything but pleasant.
</p>

<p>
Besides they had books now, and Fred and Frank
took it in turns to read to the others every night.
</p>

<p>
Sunday was kept as a complete Sabbath, or day of
rest, and prayers were said and the Bible read, and
long walks taken in the woods or along the rocks.
</p>

<p>
Fred and Frank could not help marvelling at the
wonderful tameness of the sea-birds as they sat on
their nests.  Even the frigate-bird, for example, on its
one big white egg, looked like Patience on a monument,
and was not averse to being handled.
</p>

<p>
I must tell you something about Cassia-bud's pets.
First and foremost he one day found a strange wee
bird, that had in some way or other tumbled out of its
nest.  He brought it home, nursed it and fed it
regularly day and night, but allowed it as much
freedom as it cared for.
</p>

<p>
It grew so tame that it followed the boy wherever
he went, and was as often perched on his shoulder or
head as anywhere else.  It had a low, long, plaintive
cry too, but this was reserved for Cassia-bud's especial
delectation, or for Bob's.  The bird, if not on the top
of Cassia-bud, or not eating its food, one would be sure
to find on Hurricane Bob's back.  Perhaps his long
hair kept its toes comfortable, then the dog's coat
glittered so that the bird often pretended it was water,
and went through all the motions of bathing in it.
</p>

<p>
This pet of Cassia-bud's was pure white, with two
long trailing tail feathers of charming crimson.  A
robber-crab was another strange pet the boy had.  How
he had managed to tame this droll and uncouth-looking
monster I cannot say.  He fed him regularly with
cocoa-nut, perhaps that was the secret.  The crab was
at least two feet in length, and lived in the hollow root
of a tree, always coming out, however, when the boy
called him.
</p>

<p>
Now in early spring, that is, between September and
October, the turtles used to come on shore at some
parts of the coast to lay their eggs.  It was very
curious to watch them.  They were exceedingly shy,
and usually chose a moonlight night for their work.
So having now no fear of kelpies or other apparitions,
our heroes, accompanied by Cassia-bud, used to go to a
distant part of the beach and lie in wait for the turtles.
By-and-by a great beast would be seen waddling
slowly and cautiously towards the scrub.
</p>

<p>
After listening, apparently to make sure no one is
looking, she quietly digs a deep hole about a yard in
width.  Then presently the eggs are laid, probably a
hundred or two, and one by one taken by the flipper, as
if it were a hand, and gently placed side by side in the
hole.  In about an hour's time the business is finished,
Then the eggs are covered with sand, and carefully
patted down.  Her wonderful wisdom is shown by the
tact that she even tries to conceal the place by snapping
down twigs and leaves and covering it up.  She then
waddles off towards the sea again.  Now would have
been the time for Fred and Frank to have rushed out
and tried their hands at turtle-turning.  But it seemed
the height of cruelty at such a time.  Besides, it would
have taken them a long time indeed to have eaten a
turtle.
</p>

<p>
But the eggs were very delicious.  Pure white they
are and round.  They have no shell, only a skin, and
in size are about four inches to five inches round.
</p>

<p>
Our castaways soon discovered a plan for supplying
themselves with plenty of young turtle.  They simply
took the very wee ones, after they were hatched, and
kept them in a natural sea-water reservoir near the
reef, feeding them on different kinds of weeds.  They
could in this way have stewed turtle for dinner any
day, just as in our country we have fowls.
</p>

<p>
Well, one day among the rocks, while gathering
algae to feed the juvenile turtles, Cassia-bud noticed
Bob coming wading out of the water with some huge
brown thing.  It was a turtle of small size, and
probably not very old.  Bob held it by the flipper.
When he attempted, however, to put it down he found
that this was impossible.  The turtle had seized him
by the collar, and held fast on to it.
</p>

<p>
Bob looked very serious over it.  His catching the
turtle was all very well and very clever he thought,
but to be caught by the turtle in turn was turning the
table with a vengeance.  He had caught a Tartar.  He
shook himself again and again, but all in vain.  Then
he walked straight up to Cassia-bud.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Kashie," said the dog, talking with his
eyes and his tail, "here is a pretty piece of business!
I don't want to wear this beast dangling on my breast
all my life night and day.  Can't you choke him off?"
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud couldn't choke him off, however, but he
unloosed the dog's collar; and Bob carried collar,
turtle, and all home in his mouth.  Strange to say, the
beast became as great a pet with the nigger-boy as
either the bird or the robber-crab.  Nor was the turtle
a bit particular as to what he ate, so long as he could
swallow it.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The difficulties to be encountered in building a
vessel of any size, that should be at all seaworthy,
seemed at the first blush almost insurmountable.  It
was long talked about before anything was done.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the castaways had not been idle, as far
as the preparation of wood was concerned.  Even the
youngest of my readers must be well aware that no
ship or boat even can be built of wood that has not
been properly seasoned.  Here on this strange island
timber was certainly not lacking, but the seasoning of
it, as experience soon proved to our heroes, was by no
means so easy as might be supposed; for it is as
much the wind as the sun that dries the wood, and if
done too quickly it not only warps but cracks, and is
therefore practically useless.
</p>

<p>
Many different kinds of trees were cut down and
sawn up and placed in various situations by way of
experiment; some out in the open, others in the woods,
while planks were even steeped for a time in salt
water and afterwards dried.
</p>

<p>
It was found that planks of the pandanus tree, first
steeped for a week and afterwards dried in the shade,
would, as nearly as possible, suit the purpose for which
they were required; so with greater hopes now in
their hearts they went merrily and earnestly to work.
</p>

<p>
But many months went by before they had sufficient
wood of a reliable nature to fairly commence work with.
Wooden pegs had meanwhile been carefully fashioned,
and these had all to be fire-hardened, and were, of
course, of different sizes; they were stored in the woods
under dry fibre from the cocoanut and pandanus trees.
The next thing to be done was to build a neat little
furnace in which different sized boring-irons could be
heated to redness, for Fred laughingly confessed that
his plan of making holes with rifle bullets, though
eminently practicable in warfare and house building,
was inapplicable to the building of ships.
</p>

<p>
Many and many was the sleepless night that the
planning of the yacht gave Fred, or at all events parts
of nights, for he would lie and toss about and think
till well on in the middle watch, and very often even
after he did fall asleep his tired brain kept on working
at all kinds of ridiculously impossible vessels, on the
stocks and off, till it was time to get up.
</p>

<p>
Frank did not trouble himself so much about it
</p>

<p>
"I leave it all to you, Fred," he said; "your head is
far longer than mine, and not half so thick, so you
must be like Noah of old&mdash;master, ship-builder, and
engineer all in one."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Noah," sighed Fred, "I have a higher opinion
of him now than ever; my work is nothing compared
to what his must have been."
</p>

<p>
"And I guess, sah," said Quambo, "de tools he hab
am not so good as ours, sah."
</p>

<p>
"No, Quambo, so I mustn't grumble."
</p>

<p>
"I've been thinking," said Frank one morning as
they sat together at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"Have you really?" said Fred, pretending to look
very much surprised.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, really and truly, Fred."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, Frank, will you be pleased to enlighten
us all as to the nature and result of your cogitations?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Noah the Second, instead of worrying your
self into skin and bone over this yacht business, why
don't we build a raft and be done with it?  If we once
embarked on a raft we would get blown somewhere."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it, wise Frank, we might very likely be
blown on to a coral rock in mid-ocean, and have to
begin life all over again, only in this case it would be
the life of a cockroach that has tumbled into a basin of
water, very brief but full of excitement."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," said Frank, "I shan't think any more.  I
beg leave to descend from the platform.  Pass the clams."
</p>

<p>
"That's better for you, Frank."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
But one day an event occurred that gave Fred quite
a fresh impulse, and made him determine to proceed
with the building of his yacht against every difficulty
that could be thought or dreamt of.
</p>

<p>
This was nothing more nor less than the arrival on
the island of a couple of naked savages in a small
dug-out.
</p>

<p>
It had been blowing all night a strong breeze from
the direction of the island, that from Beacon Hill could
just be seen by the aid of the telescope.  Doubtless the
savages had been carried out to sea, or they never
would have attempted so long a voyage in so small
and clumsy a craft as an outriggered dug-out.
</p>

<p>
As they drew near to the beach&mdash;exactly at the spot
where the brig went to pieces&mdash;the castaways hid
themselves in the bush, lest they should frighten them.
</p>

<p>
They landed at last, and stood wonderingly on the
sands, pointing to the ribs of the <i>Resolute</i>, that was still
visible, black and ghastly in the surf.  Tall and
noble-looking figures these savages presented.  They were
entirely naked, with the exception of a kind of
cummerbund of fibrous grass around the waist, and each
held a long spear in his hand.
</p>

<p>
The castaways now stalked out.
</p>

<p>
The savages uttered a yell, threw their spears at
them, one glancing close past Fred's head, and made a
rush for their boat.  But before ever they could get
her afloat again our men were upon them and had
made them prisoners.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap30"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX.
<br><br>
"THERE IS NO GOING BACK NOW," FRANK SAID.
</h3>

<p>
Frightened the savages certainly had been
at the sudden rush of three white men and
one black giant&mdash;Quambo&mdash;from the bush in
what they must have thought an uninhabited
island; but cowards they were not.  Indeed,
as soon as they found themselves captured
they submitted to the inevitable with a grace that was
highly dignified.
</p>

<p>
Quambo had sailed in the Southern Pacific for many
years, and was not now surprised that he could
understand the language of these men.  He was very proud,
however, at being suddenly raised to the dignity of
interpreter.  With all the inborn courage of island
warriors those savages seemed to possess the simplicity
of childhood.  They were talking to Quambo, and
pointing to Fred, when the latter begged Quambo to
translate.  "They say," said Quambo, "they not have
eat since yes'day; they say, suppose you gib 'em banana
now to eat and cocoanut water to drink, the savages
will taste yum yum when we cook and eat them."
</p>

<p>
Quambo laughed, but Fred shuddered.  What ghastly
humour was hidden in those words!
</p>

<p>
But the poor savages were at once supplied with
food and drink, and told that the white man was their
friend, and that, although they must keep them on the
island, it was only for the white man's safety, as they
did not wish to be discovered.
</p>

<p>
It is to be presumed that Quambo proved a very
faithful interpreter indeed; for the savages seized Fred's
hand, and bending low pressed it for a moment to the
forehead in a way that was most affectingly dignified.
</p>

<p>
Very much surprised, indeed, were both Cassia-bud
and Hurricane Bob, who had been left as camp keepers,
to see the party return in company with two tall and
soldierly-looking savages.  Bob at first seemed much
inclined to resent the intrusion, but as soon as matters
were explained to him he walked up to the new-comers
and licked their hands, as much as to say, "So long
as you're good you won't be touched, but I'm going to
keep my eye on you."
</p>

<p>
That evening the prisoners were allowed to dine on
the floor of the cottage, and appeared to adapt
themselves at once to their new mode of life.  They were
afterwards shown their bed under a bush.  Their canoe
had been drawn up quite close to the garden gate.
Quambo and Cassia-bud took it by turns to do sentry
duty all night, but the weary savages slept soundly,
and awoke happy, hungry, and contented.
</p>

<p>
After breakfast was over our castaways sat down
under the shadow of the trees, and the savages were
made to squat near them.  They then told their story,
and an interesting one it was.
</p>

<p>
Their home was in a group of islands far, far away
to the west.  While fishing they had been caught in a
squall and blown out to sea.  The weather had
continued very thick and bad all night, and at daybreak
they found themselves near to a strange island, and
had therefore landed in quest of food and water.  Had
they ever seen white men before? they were asked.
"Oh, yes!" they answered, holding up both hands, with
fingers outspread to indicate the number ten.  Ten
men had come, many, many moons ago, to their islands
in canoes.  They were hungry and thin, and were
accordingly housed and well fed, because the flesh of
white men is so much sweeter than that of black.
They had been well fed, better fed than pigs, the savages
explained, but would not grow fat.  But they began to
teach the natives many curious things, and to heal the
sick, and staunch blood, and do much good; so instead
of being killed and cooked they were permitted to live,
and were now slaves to the king on the far-away islands.
Where these white men had come from, they were, of
course, unable to tell.  They had come from the sea, was
all they were able to say for certain; and reckoning on
their fingers and toes the time, counted by moons, would
correspond pretty nearly with the date of the abandonment
of the brig <i>Resolute</i>.  Then Fred got Quambo to
enquire what the white men looked like.
</p>

<p>
Quambo laughed when he received their reply.
</p>

<p>
"Like de debbil hisself," he explained, "suppose the
debbil wore clothes."
</p>

<p>
Now Fred was a very fair artist in his way, for
Eean had taught him the rudiments of drawing, and
besides he seemed to have a natural gift for caricature;
so on the fly-leaf of a book he sketched a very good
likeness of the skipper of the <i>Resolute</i>&mdash;jacket, hat;
hooknose, and goatee beard all complete&mdash;in fact as he
had last seen him.
</p>

<p>
When Quambo showed the savages this they roared
with delight and astonishment, so much so in fact that
Hurricane Bob had to put himself on the defensive.
</p>

<p>
"If there is much more of that sort of thing," Bob
gave them to understand, "I'll be obliged to bring you
to your senses."
</p>

<p>
"Did they ever see that man, Quambo?" asked Fred.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  They say, sah," replied Quambo, "he
de biggest and de cleberest debbil ob all de ten, sah."
</p>

<p>
This was conclusive enough.
</p>

<p>
It was evident, therefore, that the ten poor fellows
who had landed on one of this unknown but cannibal
group of islands were a portion of the crew of the lost
brig <i>Resolute</i>, and that they still lived there as slaves.
</p>

<p>
The savages, as soon as they found out that they
were to be well fed and treated, instead of being cooked
and eaten, became very happy and contented indeed.
As a mere matter of precaution their clumsy old dug-out
was broken up and used as firewood, and after this
it became quite unnecessary to set sentries of a night
Hurricane Bob was sentry enough.  He tolerated the
savages, that was all.  He never quite trusted them.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
And now the building of the yacht was commenced
in earnest.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to be done was to erect a shed on the
beach under which the keel could be laid, and the work
carried on pleasantly and as coolly as possible.  The
dimensions of the yacht were carefully studied and
planned out; she was to have a twenty-feet keel, and
to be sufficiently narrow in beam to permit of her
being easily towed through the gap in the reef.  This
did not give her quite so much breadth as Fred could
have wished, and he determined, therefore, to give her
a good deep keel, and a not too high free-board, though
the latter must of course be consonant with safety.
</p>

<p>
The building of the workshed occupied the castaways
for the best part of a week, although they were ably
assisted by their slaves the savages.
</p>

<p>
On the particular part of the beach where the shed
was erected there was a nice slope towards the water,
though it was not too steep; and so determined was
Fred that his yacht should take the water like a duck,
that he not only laid a slip for her descent, but had
a strong railing of stanchions built on each side, so
that an accident was simply out of the question.
</p>

<p>
He was determined also that in building his yacht,
beauty and appearance should be sacrificed to safety
and strength.
</p>

<p>
And now came the laying down of the keel.  He
and Cassia-bud had wandered in the woods for weeks
scanning the trees, and at last, half-way up a hill they
had been fortunate enough to find a tree, the upper part
of whose trunk had been bent by the winds in such a
way that it would suit admirably.  When trimmed for
the keel the bent portion would represent the fore part,
that and the keel would be all in one piece.  Well
knowing that the whole build of a craft greatly depends
upon the straightness, strength, and justness of the
keel, much time was spent in forming this, and getting
it fixed in position.  But at long last Fred felt certain
he had made a fair beginning.  And now came the
question of knees and ribs, the general skeleton,
including the cross-beams, to keep all in place and to
support the decks.
</p>

<p>
As they proceeded with the making of the skeleton,
all hands, including even the savages, began to take an
intense interest in the work, and to go at it morn,
noon, and evening cheerfully.  But until he commenced
to plan and make and place the ribs, Fred had had no
idea there was so much study and thought required in
building even a boat like this.  It should be remembered
too that he was not only deficient in some most
important tools, but in iron and nails as well.
</p>

<p>
One day he held a regular survey on nails, and
finding he had so few he resolved to use pegs of hard
wood wherever possible, reserving the iron for the most
important parts.
</p>

<p>
After three weeks of the hardest work and study
ever Fred had endured in his life, the whole framework
and skeleton of the vessel was completed, and
great was the joy of the castaways accordingly.  And
to give the young man his due as a ship-builder, it
must be confessed that though her lines would not be
by any means perfection, and would neither rival those
of the model yacht <i>Thistle</i> or an Aberdeen clipper,
they were not so far out by any manner of means.
Nor would she be lopsided or in any way askew.
</p>

<p>
Being quite certain and satisfied on these points, the
work of planking the craft was cautiously and carefully
commenced.  Luckily they had the best of planes, and
they had splendid wood, so this part of the work went
on smoothly and merrily enough, and every day Fred's
men, as he called them, improved in the niceties of
their trade of ship-carpentering.
</p>

<p>
But how genuinely tired and hungry they used to
be of an evening!
</p>

<p>
Ah! well, the dinner that Cassia-bud prepared
entirely banished the hunger, and a rest afterwards
either in the cottage-orn√©e as a book was being read, or
outside around the camp fire, made them forget all the
toils and worries of the day.  In fact, every evening
the castaways gave themselves up body and soul to the
enjoyment of the <i>dolce far niente</i>.  In plainer language,
they had nothing to do, and they did it well.
</p>

<p>
Reading indoors was all very well, but they enjoyed
lazing in the sand by the camp fire far better.  The nights
at present were nearly always fine.  There was the glitter
of stars or glimmer of moonlight on the quiet sea.
</p>

<p>
There were fire-flies and a hundred other phosphorescent
things flitting or crawling in garden, trees, or
bush; there was the soft whispering of the breeze
through the branches; the lulling sound of falling
waters on the far-off reef; and above all there was the
companionship of the log fire itself, that somehow
never failed to talk to Fred and Frank, and tell them
tales of their British home.
</p>

<p>
Songs were never forgotten around the camp fire, and
there is no saying how much good they did not effect.
Why, those songs used to please even the savages, and
it was amusing, if not affecting, to hear them join in
singing "Home, Sweet Home," or "Auld Lang Syne."
</p>

<p>
Before the deck of the vessel was completely planked
over, the ballast was carefully adjusted and fastened
down to the sturdy boat's bottom.
</p>

<p>
While digging in the garden Quambo had come upon
quite a store of a curious kind of amber-like gum.
This was melted and mixed in a cask containing a
reddish pigment kind of earth, and lo! a paint of a
pitchy nature was formed, and every seam of the
yacht, outside and in, was carefully done over with this
twice, and they had the satisfaction of finding that it
did not become too brittle when dry.  The same red
earth was mixed with oil and a portion of the gum,
and formed an excellent paint to go over all the work
with before the vessel was launched.
</p>

<p>
Two hatches were fitted, each having rough, short
ladders descending to the hold, or fore-cabin and saloon,
as Fred grandly termed them.
</p>

<p>
The rudder was next made, and properly and scientifically
shipped, and a handy tiller adjusted.  Then
the mast and a short jibboom were stepped, and after
this the vessel was ready for launching, for they longed
to prove if she was seaworthy.
</p>

<p>
Fred could not remember ever having longed for
anything half so much as he longed to see the yacht
afloat, and if real shipbuilders are as anxious for some
days before they succeed in launching their ventures,
then they must have a very uneasy time indeed.
</p>

<p>
But the eventful morning arrived at last, and the
vessel was duly christened, not with a bottle of wine
it is true, but with the milk of a beautiful green
cocoanut, and named the <i>Island Queen</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Let go all now!" cried Fred.
</p>

<p>
Props were knocked out, the little ship swerved and
swayed for a moment, then gently commenced her
descent, moving on without a hitch, and finally taking
the water just like the perfect duck she was unanimously
declared to be.  Of course they gave her three
times three cheers as she slid into the water, with
another little cheer for luck; then everybody crowded
round Fred Arundel, the worthy shipbuilder, and
shook hands with him in the most approved style;
after which all retired to a sumptuous breakfast,
quaffing the cocoa-nut of peace, as Frank called it, and
wishing jolly good luck to the <i>Island Queen</i>.
</p>

<p>
"I think I can eat to-day," said Fred, with a soft
sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you ought, Fred," said Frank, "for you are
positively getting thin."
</p>

<p>
They had not considered yet what they were going
to do with their yacht, or where they should venture
to sail to.  They were possessed of no chart of the
seas around here, but as near as Fred could judge they
must be fully a thousand miles from either Auckland
or Fiji.  Would it or would it not be dangerous to
make so long a journey in so small and frail a craft?
All agreed, anyhow, that an attempt should be made
to rescue the ten men who were still held prisoners, if
not even made slaves of, in the cannibal islands from
which the two savages had arrived.
</p>

<p>
Every preparation for the voyage was set about,
therefore, without any loss of time.
</p>

<p>
Luckily they had plenty of spare canvas that had
been found in the wreck, so the rigging, &amp;c., of the
<i>Island Queen</i> was perfected in a few days' time.
</p>

<p>
Then the first trial trip was made.  The boat was
sailed and manoeuvred all round the bay at first.  Then
she was towed with a boat ahead through the gap.  It
would have been risking too much to have sailed
through, for at any moment a sea might have lifted
her and carried her against the sharp coral rocks, after
which there would have been no more <i>Island Queen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Once away out on the billowy breast of the blue
ocean, all sail was set, and the craft was tried in every
manner that could occur to a thorough seaman, and
behaved herself in everything as a beauty.
</p>

<p>
"She's a beauty, Fred, a beauty," Frank said, over
and over again, "and does you ample credit."
</p>

<p>
"Does us, you mean."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, Fred, old man.  Honour to whom honour is
due.  Yours was the working head, ours only the
willing hands."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
On a bright and beautiful morning, with a gentle
breeze blowing from the nor'ard and west, the manned
and armed cruiser-yacht <i>Island Queen</i> left her
anchorage in the bay near which our heroes had resided
so long, and sailing easily through the reef gap,
hoisted all sail again, and steered to the east away.
</p>

<p>
The Isle of Good Hope kept receding and receding
as the day wore on, till at eventide it was seen but as
a green cloud far away on the ocean's horizon.
</p>

<p>
But higher land was steadily rising ahead.  Other
green clouds appeared.  A whole group of islands
stretched out before them, and be their fate what it
might they would cast anchor among them early next
morning, if the wind but held.
</p>

<p>
Both Fred and Frank were uneasy in their minds.
</p>

<p>
"There is no going back now," Frank said.
</p>

<p>
"Come weal or come woe," replied Fred with great
earnestness, "we shall do our duty, and trust all the
rest to a Higher Power."
</p>

<p>
"Amen," said Frank.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br><br>
IN CANNIBAL ISLANDS.
</h3>

<p>
The crew of the derelict brig <i>Resolute</i> had
certainly not been idle during the year and
a half and over they had been prisoners on
the cannibal islands.  It was perhaps a
lucky day for the natives when their boats
drew up upon the beach with the sailors,
more dead than alive, without arms or clothes, except
what they wore, completely at the mercy of the naked
and fierce-looking savages that crowded round them.
</p>

<p>
Here was a chance for these islanders, such as might
not occur again in a score of years.  Nothing could
be more to their taste than the programme mapped
out by their chief, and to be carried out on the
following day.
</p>

<p>
First, Revenge.  For they could not forget that long
ago a white man's ship had cast anchor in this very
bay, and that they had treated the men who landed
with kindness and hospitality, albeit they would have
preferred picking their bones.  They remembered that
event, and they did not forget either that in return
for their hospitality those white fiends stole their
women and their little ones, and put out to sea.
Revenge is sweet.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, a short but bloody massacre of these
innocent white men.
</p>

<p>
And thirdly, a glorious feast of roasted flesh to
follow&mdash;a feast of white men's flesh, that they should look
back to with satisfaction and delight as long as they
lived.
</p>

<p>
So next morning the island had been all <i>en gala</i>.
Huge fires were built on which to roast the sailors
whole, and big round stones made hot to place in their
insides, so that both outside and inside they might be
done to a turn.
</p>

<p>
But, lo! when they had dragged the miserable sailors
out of the compound, and everybody was itching to
club them, they had found they were little more than
skin and bone and grief.
</p>

<p>
This would never do; they must be fed and fattened.
So they were penned in the king's own compound.
But somehow they couldn't or wouldn't fatten; and
besides, the king began to be mightily entertained with
them.  Seeing that this was the case, not only the
Yankee skipper himself, but his nine men&mdash;all the rest
of his crew, by the way, had been drowned&mdash;set
themselves to please.  They danced, they sang, and they
even boxed with each other, all for this sable and
savage King Ota's delectation.
</p>

<p>
Ota soon found out he had drawn a real prize in the
lottery of life, and would now no more have consented
to kill and eat his prisoners than you, reader, would
your pet and expensive pigeons.
</p>

<p>
But meanwhile another savage king on another
island had heard of Ota's luck, and sent to beg for
half the white men, that he too might be tickled and
amused.  Ota replied, saying he would see the other
king skinned first.
</p>

<p>
Well, there was some skinning after this; for that
other king invaded Ota's island, and the battle on the
beach raged fierce and bloody for many a long hour.
The Yankee skipper and his merry men had been
obliged to join the fight on Ota's side, and victory
was at last obtained.  The other king's men fled
seaward in their boats, leaving more than a hundred dead
and wounded on the beach.  But the dreadful cruelties
to the prisoners, and the awful orgies that were carried
on for many days afterwards, I have no language to
describe.
</p>

<p>
When all the killed were eaten, the bones were
taken to "ornament" the kraal of the king, round
which the savage soldiers danced and howled for days
and nights to the unearthly music of tom-toms and
conch-shells, accompanied by rattles made of the dead
men's skulls with pebbles in them, and much yelling
and brandishing of spears.
</p>

<p>
This feast, from first to last, was so terrible that the hair
of several of the sailors turned white before it ended.
</p>

<p>
But peace ever since then had reigned in King Ota's
island, and he had even become friendly again with
the king who lived on the other side of the water.
However, Ota would never permit his white men to go
on the sea in a boat or canoe.  They were too useful
to risk.  They built him a whole cottage, and taught
his people to do many wonderful things.  They laid
out gardens even, in which yams and sweet potatoes,
with cassava root and many other vegetables, flourished
most luxuriantly.
</p>

<p>
But for all the king's kindness to them&mdash;and in
a savage kind of way he really did treat them well&mdash;the
poor white men pined, and longed to see a ship
appear on the horizon.
</p>

<p>
Every morning of their lives when they left the huts
in which they slept, guarded as prisoners, they betook
themselves towards the hill-top.
</p>

<p>
They told Ota they went thither to pray.  Well, to
their credit be it said, they did pray; but many was
the wistful glance they cast seawards in hopes of
catching sight of the coming ship.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
One morning the ship did heave in sight.
</p>

<p>
That ship was the little <i>Island Queen</i>.
</p>

<p>
Just an hour after she had first been sighted, Ota,
the king, called his prisoners before him.
</p>

<p>
A translation of the speech he made then would
read somewhat as follows:
</p>

<p>
"White men people.  King Ota is the biggest king in
all the wide world.  There is no end to his greatness
or his glory.  He has destroyed his enemies in many a
bloody battle both by sea and land, and cooked and
eaten them afterwards.  Even the birds of the air fly
round the head of King Ota when he takes his walks
abroad, and scream their worship in his large and
willing ears.  And the dark frigate bird, the <i>eewaoo</i>,
carries the story of King Ota's glory to the utmost
regions of the earth.  King Ota's arm is very strong,
but King Ota's heart is as big and soft as a <i>jeetee</i> (the
jelly fish).  When Ota saw the poor white sailors land
on his shore, his first thought was to club and eat them,
after smearing his wives and little ones with their
bright red blood.  But his soft <i>jeetee</i> heart forbade;
so he has kept them, and is very kind to them.  But
now behold a white man's ship has appeared in the
bay, and they may want to take the king's dear prisoners
away.  But they must not know they are here.  I
must hide them in the innermost shades of the forest,
and keep them secure until the ship departs.  Away
with them guards, and if they attempt to escape kill
them, and we will feast ourselves on their bodies."
</p>

<p>
This was a sad sentence, but there was no relenting
in King Ota, so they were marched away into the
depths of a dark wood, and imprisoned in a bamboo
hut, which was guarded by the spearsmen of the
savage king.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Now, Frank," said Fred, "what is to be done first?"
</p>

<p>
That is what Captain Arundel, of the model yacht
<i>Island Queen</i> said, as soon as the anchor was let go in
the beautiful bay off the Isle of Ota.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I should like to know, Fred," was
Frank's reply.  "I'm ready to obey you in everything,
and fight for you, and stick by you to the last; but,
faith, Fred, I'm a poor hand at giving advice."
</p>

<p>
"I should say," said Mac, "we'd better first try to
make friends with these black beggars."
</p>

<p>
"They don't look very friendly," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
This was true; for though many dug-outs had
shoved off from the shore, they kept severely aloof
from the little yacht.
</p>

<p>
Quambo was sent down below to question the two
captured savages, whom it was thought advisable for
the present to keep out of sight.
</p>

<p>
The savages assured Quambo that this really was
Ota's island, but that he would doubtless not permit
the white men to appear.  If they could lure the crew
of the <i>Island Queen</i> on shore, they would, said they,
kill and eat them, but they would not attack the vessel
till nightfall.
</p>

<p>
This was a rather gloomy outlook, and as no white
men could be seen on the beach, Fred could only come
to the conclusion that they were hidden away somewhere.
He determined, however, that he would not be
deterred from landing and seeking an interview with
the king on the beach.
</p>

<p>
So Fred, with Quambo and Mac, lowered the boat,
and boldly proceeded to row towards the shore.  Quambo
was to act as interpreter.
</p>

<p>
The boat was fully armed with revolvers and rifles,
with spears also, lest they might have to come into
close quarters with the cannibals.
</p>

<p>
The canoes certainly did not scatter in all directions
at the approach of the white men's boat, but they drew
sullenly off.
</p>

<p>
When within thirty yards of the shore they lay on
their oars, and immediately afterwards the beach
swarmed with spear-armed, wildly-gesticulating savages.
Among them was a personage arrayed in an old pilot
jacket, and nothing else, so that with his long black
legs sticking out from under he had anything but a
very imposing appearance.
</p>

<p>
He had a spear in his right hand, and by a string in
the other was leading along a good-sized pig, of all
creatures in the world.
</p>

<p>
Conversation was at once opened up, and proceeded
somewhat as follows:
</p>

<p>
<i>Quambo</i>.  "Are you the king of this island?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Ota</i>.  "I am King Ota, the greatest king in all the
world."
</p>

<p>
<i>Quambo</i>.  "And we are poor white men who want
food and water."
</p>

<p>
<i>Ota</i>.  "I have brought this pig to make you a present
of.  How much will you pay me for this pig?"
</p>

<p>
"That's a queer way of making a present," said
Fred, when the king's words were interpreted.  "Tell
him we will give him a beautiful jacket and a pair of
white duck trousers to hide his dirty black legs.  Hold
up the garments."
</p>

<p>
<i>Quambo</i> (holding up the trousers and blue jacket).
"Here, O great and good king, we have brought
you a coat for your brave body, and a pair of white
ducks for your lovely legs!"
</p>

<p>
<i>Ota</i>.  "Land and leave them."
</p>

<p>
<i>Quambo</i>.  "No, leave the pig, and we will land and
exchange; but you must retire."
</p>

<p>
Fred now determined to bring matters to a crisis.
These savages had never seen or heard of fire-arms, so
now raising a rifle to his shoulder he took aim and
fired, and, lo! Ota's pig dropped dead at his feet.  The
smoke had hardly cleared away till, with terrible shouts
and shrieks, the savages had fled in all directions.  For
just one brief moment the greatest king in all the
world stood looking down at poor piggie weltering in
its gore, then with an eldritch scream he too fled away.
</p>

<p>
"Pull on shore quickly now, lads," cried Fred, and
the boat was quickly beached.  The pig was lifted on
board, the jacket and trousers laid on the sands, and
off they shoved again, and were soon once more safely
on their own quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
In an hour's time, however, they had the satisfaction
of seeing King Ota come down to the beach, dress in
the new clothes, then stride gallantly away, followed
by all his sable suite.
</p>

<p>
Instead of lying at anchor all night, and probably
thus courting an attack, it was thought advisable to
put out to sea, where they could bid defiance to a
whole fleet of armed canoes.
</p>

<p>
The king presented himself on the beach next day,
but he had no pig.  It was noticed too that not a
woman or child was permitted to appear; and this
Quambo assured Fred was a certain sign that these
savages meant to fight.
</p>

<p>
Now fighting was no part of Fred's policy.  With
all his courage and daring it would be ruinous not only
for his party, but for those he sought to rescue, to go to
war with these savages.  Against such numbers he
could only act on the defensive, and this but for a
very short time.  So he determined to make friends
by every means in his power.  He once more, therefore,
drew near to the beach and held parley with King Ota,
or King Breeches, as Magilvray called him.
</p>

<p>
Fred informed him that he came now on a friendly
mission; that he desired everlasting peace between the
white men and the blacks; and that in proof of this
if he, King Ota, would venture on board he should
be treated kindly and receive many more presents,
even a fire-stick such as he, Fred, had slain the pig
with the day before.
</p>

<p>
The offer of a gun was certainly a great temptation,
but it evidently was not great enough to induce King
Ota to risk his sacred person on board the <i>Island
Queen</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Would the white man leave the fire-stick on the
beach and go away?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No; the white man would do nothing of the sort."
</p>

<p>
"Would the white man then kill something else?"
</p>

<p>
To this Fred made reply, that if the greatest king in
all the world wanted a pig for his own dinner, and
would bring one to the beach, the white man would
kill it.
</p>

<p>
On this the king seemed suddenly to be struck by
a happy thought.  He held communication with his
dusky warriors; a few of them retired to the bush, and
after a while re-appeared dragging along a poor woman.
She was stationed on the fore-shore, and stood there
with drooping head patiently waiting for the death she
expected.  The king and his warriors stood aside at a
safe distance.  Then pointing to the woman Ota hailed
the boat.  "That is the pig that the greatest king in
all the world wants to eat for dinner, make fire, quick,
quick."
</p>

<p>
Fred felt strangely tempted to give the king himself
a shot.  So inhuman a monster he had never before
held communication with.
</p>

<p>
At this moment a huge black-brown kite came
wheeling round his dusky majesty's head; slowly it
sailed tack and half tack.
</p>

<p>
Now Mac had been the best shot in the <i>San Salvador</i>.
Fred gave him the rifle.
</p>

<p>
"Bring down that bird," he cried.  "Pray don't
miss."
</p>

<p>
Steady was the aim Magilvray now took.  Bang
went the rifle.  The king's eyes were turned towards
the poor woman, his face beaming with fiendish delight
in the expectation of seeing her fall.  Instead of that
there alighted on his royal head a huge mass of blood
and feathers.  He uttered a yell that could have been
heard a good mile off, and threw himself struggling on
the ground.
</p>

<p>
It was a rash thing for Fred to do; but there was
no help for it now, and almost before Quambo and
Magilvray could get way on the boat spears were
hurled after them, and a wild rush made towards
the canoes.
</p>

<p>
That was indeed a race for life; but Quambo and
Mac made the gig fly and skip across the water, and
not only were they aboard, but the boat was hauled up,
before the savages in their clumsy canoes could get
alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Shake out the mainsail.  Get the anchor up."  These
were the orders now.
</p>

<p>
Just one volley was fired at the advancing canoes,
which staggered and sent them back, and before they
had recovered from their consternation the sails were
set, and the <i>Island Queen</i> stood steadily out to sea.
</p>

<p>
But the shooting of that foul bird had ruined
everything, as far as peace was concerned.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXII.
<br><br>
THE WHOLE BEACH WAS LINED WITH YELLING SAVAGES.
</h3>

<p>
Captain Fred Arundel, of the <i>Island
Queen</i>, now left the island of King Ota far
astern, and proceeded to take a quiet survey
of the whole group.
</p>

<p>
The islands were five in all, although one
was so small as hardly to be worthy of notice.  It is
nevertheless the most important of all to our story.
This little isle, although well treed, was evidently not
inhabited, and had only one landing-place, all the rest
of its shore being as inaccessible as the Bass Rock
itself.
</p>

<p>
The other islands were inhabited, as well they
might be; for in rugged grandeur of contour, and in
beauty of tropical foliage, they exceeded anything that
Fred or Frank could have imagined or dreamt about.
</p>

<p>
Waving cocoa-nut and palm trees, gigantic tree ferns,
bananas, pandanus, and bread fruits, and a wealth of
waving woods and grasses and flowers, that made them
look like veritable fairy-lands afloat, or the fabled
islands of the blessed dead we read of in the classics.
Yet everyone of them was the abode of savages and
cannibals.  No boats came off from either, though in
one of the bays Fred lay at anchor for very many
hours.
</p>

<p>
He was concocting a bold and daring scheme,
which if successful should mean freedom for the white
prisoners, whatever might befall them next; but if
unsuccessful it would mean death, or a slavery far
worse than death, for all concerned.
</p>

<p>
That the inhabitants of these islands were not really
bad at heart was Fred's evident thought, from the
kindly way their own two prisoners took to work and
civilization.
</p>

<p>
Could the latter be trusted in a matter of life and
death?  Fred made up his mind to try them.
</p>

<p>
So they were now brought on deck and questioned
by Quambo, questions and answers being very much as
follows:
</p>

<p>
Why did they&mdash;the white men&mdash;see nothing of their
brothers who were held as slaves by King Ota?  King
Ota was too clever.  He kept them in the forest prison.
Did they know the road from the beach to this
prison?  They knew many roads to it.
</p>

<p>
Could they and would they be willing to guide a
party to this bamboo prison through the forest at the
darkest hour of midnight?  Yes, they could and would
gladly, the white men had been very good to them;
but if they guided them to their white brothers they
must promise to take them&mdash;the guides&mdash;away with
them, else King Ota would put them to death with
much terrible torture.
</p>

<p>
So far then everything seemed satisfactory, and Fred
and Frank resolved to risk all in one bold effort to set
the white men free.
</p>

<p>
"To dare is to do, Frank," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Frank, "and I should never forgive
myself if we went away and left these poor fellows
prisoners and slaves among these terrible cannibals.
I cannot forget, Fred, that the Yankee skipper was
kind to me when I was sick, and that he was my
captain, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, Frank, when does the moon rise, to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"What, will you venture so soon?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know what a nervous coward of a chap I
am!  If I've got to face anything I like to go at it at
once.  Besides, it is best to strike the iron when it is
hot."
</p>

<p>
"All right," said Frank.  "I must say, however, Fred,
that your cowardice is of a very peculiar kind, from all
the specimens I've had of it lately."
</p>

<p>
And now the two savages were once more interrogated,
and it was soon found that from the back part of the
island, where the pandanus forest grew right down to
the water's edge, a footpath led up through the woods
to the bamboo prison or fort.  It would no doubt be
well guarded, but nothing venture nothing win.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He either fears his fate too much,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or his deserts are small,<br>
  Who dares not put it to the test,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To win or lose it all."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
These lines are well worth remembering, and everyone
who reads British history must be struck with the
fact, that nearly all our greatest victories have been
won by downright pluck and derring-do.
</p>

<p>
Well, everything seemed to favour our heroes to-night;
for the moon would not rise until nearly two
o'clock, a favouring breeze was blowing, and there
would be light enough from the stars to creep round to
the back of King Ota's island and let go anchor.  All
the rest must be left.
</p>

<p>
The sun went down at six o'clock.  Then dinner was
got through, and preparations at once made for the
adventure.
</p>

<p>
Luckily they had plenty of revolvers on board, saved
from the brig, and good ones too, the revolver being
a tool as common on board all Yankee foreign-going
ships as toothpicks, more or less.
</p>

<p>
A dozen and a half of these were most carefully
loaded with ball cartridges.  Ten of these were placed in
a hand-bag or grip-sack, and this Quambo was to carry.
Fred, Frank, and Quambo, with one of the savages,
were to take part in this cutting-out expedition; little
Cassia-bud, all by himself, was to remain with the
other savage as ship-keeper; while Mac would come
along to take charge of the boat.
</p>

<p>
Cassia-bud would be captain of the <i>Island Queen</i>
therefore for once in a way, and Hurricane Bob
assured the boy that he would keep his eagle eye on
the remaining black fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Would it not, sir," said Mac, "be as well to
handcuff the darkie we leave behind?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Fred boldly.  "I have told these men I
trust them, and trust them now I must and will."
</p>

<p>
About ten o'clock the <i>Island Queen</i> quietly got up
anchor and sail, and began her dangerous voyage.
</p>

<p>
It was indeed in every way an expedition fraught
with the greatest danger.  To begin with, they were in
an unknown sea, where they must trust to Providence
to keep them off rocks and shoals.  Secondly, after
they landed their lives were in the hands of the guide,
who might, if he chose, lead them into the very midst
of the enemy; and even if he proved true, they had
the guards to silence, if nothing worse.
</p>

<p>
All hands were armed to the teeth, and the boat's
oars were muffled.
</p>

<p>
It still wanted half an hour of midnight when the
yacht crept slowly in towards the darkling shore, and
the anchor was let silently down.
</p>

<p>
Finally the boat was lowered, and everything being
ready, she was shoved off and silently rowed towards
the shore.
</p>

<p>
Stars were all out and shining, but the woods lay
still and quiet under their feeble light.  Not a word
was spoken by any one on board; but just before the
boat was run upon the soft white sand Fred felt for
Frank's hand and pressed it.
</p>

<p>
Frank well knew what was meant.
</p>

<p>
Then the landing was effected, Fred whispering some
words in Mac's ear just before the three brave men
headed by their savage guide, dipped into the dark
woods and commenced the march.
</p>

<p>
Silently, and in single file, they followed on and on.
It seemed a very, very long mile, and more than once
Fred suspected treachery.  So too did Frank.  If
treachery it was going to be, they at all events had
resolved to sell their lives as dearly as possible; and
it was satisfactory to remember they were venturing
those lives in a worthy cause.
</p>

<p>
"Hist!"  It was a signal from the guide.
</p>

<p>
All stopped, then cautiously advanced again.  In a
minute more they came in view of the bamboo prison.
And yonder were the guards, seated by a blazing
log fire&mdash;a fire that revealed their fiercely-savage
faces, but left all else in Rembrandtesque darkness.
</p>

<p>
Savoo, the guide, pointed to a spot just behind them,
and whispered to Quambo.
</p>

<p>
Quambo in his turn conferred with Fred and Frank,
and in a moment a plan of action was agreed to.
</p>

<p>
Quambo was to rush on, and throwing his huge bulk
against the door, burst it open, while the other three
settled matters with the spear-armed sentries.
</p>

<p>
For that matter they might have shot them where
they sat; but Fred was averse to using firearms before
it was absolutely necessary.
</p>

<p>
Savoo was armed with a huge club.  Fred and Frank,
in addition to their revolvers, had each a sword.
</p>

<p>
"Are we all ready?"
</p>

<p>
"All ready."
</p>

<p>
"Then dash on."
</p>

<p>
Quambo was first.  He thrust at one of the guards
with his spear as he passed; but, rushing on and
heeding nothing, hurled his whole gigantic force against
the frail bamboo door.
</p>

<p>
It gave way at once.  It flew into flinders in fact.
Meanwhile, Savoo, club in hand, had followed
Quambo to the fire.
</p>

<p>
Thud!  thud!  Two awful blows; and the two
remaining sentries were disposed of, and stretched
beside the one Quambo had speared.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing left for Fred or Frank to do.
</p>

<p>
"Friends," cried Quambo as soon as the door flew
open, "are you all here, men?"
</p>

<p>
"The Lord's name be praised!" cried the Yankee
skipper, "whoever you are.  But we're all tied and
trussed like fowls goin' to the market."
</p>

<p>
Frank was beside his old captain in a minute, and
Fred showed a light from his bull's-eye lantern.
</p>

<p>
What a fearful sight!  Every man was tied up in a
bundle, as it were; and when the cords were cut, for a
few moments they scarce could stand.
</p>

<p>
Here was a new danger that had not even been
thought of.  They could not carry the men, and what
if they could not walk?
</p>

<p>
But the odour of their prison was like that of some
vile charnel-house; and it was as much this as their
cramped position that rendered them so helpless.
</p>

<p>
They revived very soon after they were brought into
the open air, and were able to receive each a revolver
from Quambo's grip-sack.  Then the return journey
was at once commenced.
</p>

<p>
They reached the beach in safety, and half the party
were at once rowed off to the vessel.  Fred, Frank,
and Quambo remained behind with two men&mdash;one
being the Yankee skipper himself.  This was the most
anxious time of all for Fred and Frank, and the
longest too, apparently.
</p>

<p>
Do what Fred would, he could not keep that Yankee
skipper's tongue silent.
</p>

<p>
To be sure he talked in a kind of half whisper, but
the night was so terribly still that even this could be
heard a good long way off.
</p>

<p>
"What I'm terribly vexed about," was one of the
skipper's remarks, "is that I didn't have it out wi' that
rascal, King Ota."
</p>

<p>
"Hush, hush!" whispered Frank.  "Not so loud
please, captain."
</p>

<p>
"The skunk," he continued, "to truss us all up
like fowls."
</p>

<p>
Fred lost his temper now.  "Look here, sir," he said,
"I'm in command here, and if you say another word
I'll gag you&mdash;there!"
</p>

<p>
"I say, youngster," whispered the Yankee in a kind
of wheedling tone, "gag me with a lump o' baccy.
I'd give ten years of my sinful life for a chew."
</p>

<p>
In spite of the extreme danger they were in Fred
could not keep from smiling.
</p>

<p>
But Quambo stuck a big lump of tobacco in the
skipper's hand, and he was silent after this.  "Hist!"  It
was the voice of the guide again.  He had clutched
Fred's arm and was pointing away to the woods.
</p>

<p>
Fred could hear nothing for a time.  At last,
however, a confused noise of tom-tom beating, couch
blowing, and yelling, was borne to his ears on the night
breeze.  It was only too evident that the escape of the
prisoners had already been discovered, that the whole
island was alarmed, and that the savages had found
their trail.
</p>

<p>
Again and again Fred flashed his light towards the
<i>Island Queen</i>, to induce the speedy return of the boat.
But seawards all was silent.
</p>

<p>
And every minute the shouting and yelling in the
woods drew nearer and nearer.
</p>

<p>
Both Frank and Fred did feel fear now.  They stood
almost face to face with a terrible death, knowing well
too that if caught alive they would be put to the torture.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer!  Would the boat never come?
</p>

<p>
At last, oh, joy! a black spot suddenly appeared
among the surf, and they made a dash towards it.
</p>

<p>
None too soon, for hardly had they left the shore
ere the whole beach was lined by the howling savages.
Spears whirled past them in the darkness, and shots
were returned from the boat.
</p>

<p>
Fred presently heard a dull thud close beside him in
the boat.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" groaned the Yankee skipper.  "That's got me.
Poor Silas is to be sewed up at last."
</p>

<p>
"Has the spear hit you?" said Frank anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Gone clean through and through me.  Oh, don't
attempt to draw it out!  Blood will flow in bucketfuls
if you do.  No, let me just collect my thoughts and try
to pray a bit.  Oh! ain't got nary a cigar about you,
'ave you?"
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the boat was speeding across the water
towards the <i>Island Queen</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, be careful now!" cried Silas.  "I tell you I'm
pinned clean through the body on to the gunwale of
the boat."
</p>

<p>
Fred showed his light.  The spear certainly appeared
to be sticking right through Silas like a pin through a
moth.  But more minute investigation showed it had
only gone through his jacket and shirt, grazing his skin.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said coolly, "well shiver me if I didn't
think I was a gone coon!"
</p>

<p>
In less than ten minutes after, all were on board, the
sails were filled, and the <i>Island Queen</i> was standing
rapidly out to sea.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIII.
<br><br>
SOUTH AND SOUTH SAILED THE GOOD BARQUE.
</h3>

<p>
The word "Sarpinto" kept ringing in the old
fisherman bard's ears as he retired to bed
that night.
</p>

<p>
I believe the last words he said to himself
as he laid his head on the pillow were "Sarpinto,
Sarpinto, where on earth have I heard the name!
Sar&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was asleep before he could finish the word, but
when he awoke next morning he did finish it.  "Pinto,"
he muttered to himself, "Pinto, yes, now I have it.
That was part of the word that I read on the bill of
lading that came on shore with dear Toddie, and that
Bunko afterwards found in the log of wood.  Pinto!  I
have it.  How singular now if this Se√±or Sarpinto turned
out to be nobody else but Toddie's wicked uncle."
</p>

<p>
Captain Cawdor was not an early riser, as the term
is understood by the fisherfolks of Methlin, but on this
particular morning he was up and out by seven o'clock.
</p>

<p>
He found Eean anxiously waiting for him.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me for a stroll," said Eean, "as far as a
cave I have here.  Ah!  Toddy darling, here you are."
</p>

<p>
Toddie, who was quite a tall and very pretty girl,
now threw her arms about the old bard's neck to give
him a morning kiss, and receive his blessing.  Then
she shyly gave a hand to Captain Cawdor.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you can come with us, pet," said the bard.
"It is about you we are going to talk."
</p>

<p>
So the three walked along the cliff-top, and finally
descended to the cave.
</p>

<p>
And there Eean, with the paper in his hand, told
Captain Cawdor the whole of Toddie's strange story,
as far as he himself knew it.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange story certainly, but simple enough
in the main.  There surely was nothing in it to strike
so sturdy and hardy an old seafarer as Captain Cawdor
speechless.  But that is precisely the effect it had on
this ancient mariner.
</p>

<p>
His eyes had got bigger and bigger as Eean proceeded,
and as he finished his jaw had actually dropped.
</p>

<p>
He found his tongue at last, however.  Then three
times in succession he thumped his red round fist on
the deal table in front of him, and three times in
succession he muttered the words:
</p>

<p>
"Bless my soul, sir!  Bless my soul!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what is it?" said Eean.  "Do you know
anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Do I know <i>any</i> thing, man?  Bless you and me
both, I know <i>every</i> thing.  I declare I'm half afraid
wonders will never cease."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Eean, "it is all very wonderful, but tell
us all you know; for I am certain my little girl here
is quite as anxious to hear about her early history as I
am.  And I pray God this moment, Captain Cawdor,
that you will tell us nothing that can result in parting
me and my more than child."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay," cried Captain Cawdor, earnestly and
thoughtfully, as Toddie had thrown herself on old
Eean's lap, and was nestling close to his breast.
</p>

<p>
"I'm certain sure you won't be parted; for Se√±or
Sarpinto&mdash;and he really is Toddie's uncle&mdash;is one of the
kindest men that ever breathed, and an ill-used man
he has been."
</p>

<p>
"But," said Eean, "the paper here calls him a villain.
See!  Read for yourself."
</p>

<p>
Captain Cawdor adjusted his glasses, and glanced at
the frayed and worn manuscript Eean placed in his
hands.
</p>

<p>
"Nay, nay, sir, here you have made a great mistake.
You will note, sir, that the words 'uncle'&mdash;'villain'&mdash;and
'malediction' are widely separated, and that a
deal that has been written between them has been
frayed out and obliterated.  The word 'villain' doesn't
refer to my dear, kind-hearted friend Sarpinto, nor the
word 'malediction' either."
</p>

<p>
"You relieve my mind considerably, Captain Cawdor,
but pray proceed."
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, on our passage back from the southern
seas, Sarpinto and I got very chummy indeed.  Although
he is a Spaniard, he is a man nobody could help loving.
He told me all his life story.  But I need tell you no
more at present than what refers to the dear wee lady
there.
</p>

<p>
"They were twins, sir, the brothers Sarpinto, and
loved each other as dearly as brothers should.  The
only misfortune in their lives was their both falling
deeply in love with the same young lady.  No fault of
hers, mind you.  By all accounts that child's mother was
an angel.  She loved the sailor brother best, however,
and she married him, and sailed with him wherever he
went.  And never, mind you, did this sailor know his
brother's secret.  But, between you and me, it broke
this brother's heart, though he still lives.  And while
he lives he'll roam and rove around the wide
world in quest of adventures, for, alas! he cannot
rest.
</p>

<p>
"Now, sir," continued Captain Cawdor, "do you
begin to see how the land lies?"
</p>

<p>
"I do," said Eean.
</p>

<p>
"Se√±or Sarpinto's sailor brother, on his last voyage,
carried with him much specie, and it was not till long
after he had sailed that the Se√±or found out there had
sailed with him in disguise one of the blackest-hearted
villains that ever drew a knife.  The ship was the
<i>Santa Maria</i> sure enough, and the very commonness of
the name threw the Se√±or off the scent, and he does
not know now, of course, that his niece here is alive
and well, and in such fatherly arms."
</p>

<p>
The captain ceased to speak, and after a moment's
pause Eean rose slowly from his seat and held out his
hand, which the sailor grasped right heartily.
</p>

<p>
"You are a good man," he said, "and God has sent
you."
</p>

<p>
"And now," he added, as he reseated himself, "my
duty lies before me more clearly than before."
</p>

<p>
"And that is?"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"That is to return with you to America, and see this
Se√±or Sarpinto for myself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, daddy," cried Toddie, "you will not leave me."
</p>

<p>
"Nay, child, you too shall go.  I feel we will not be
separated."
</p>

<p>
"That you won't, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So cheer up, darling, you shall see a little of the
world yet."
</p>

<p>
"And, oh, daddy, I feel sure of one thing."
</p>

<p>
"What, dear?"
</p>

<p>
"That we shall find Fred and Frank too."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord send that your words may come true,"
said Eean piously.
</p>

<p>
Then all three returned slowly along the cliff-top.
</p>

<p>
There was much talk and wonderment in the wee
village of Methlin, when it got bruited abroad that
Eean and his daughter, as Toddie was always called,
were going off with the strange sailor gentleman to
America.
</p>

<p>
And almost the first to hear of it was Bunko, the
herd.
</p>

<p>
Now of late years, through the earnest and indefatigable
teaching of Eean, a very great change had come
over this strange lad.  Simple he might still have been
called, but half-witted no longer.  He went straight
away now and sought audience of Eean.
</p>

<p>
"I hear," he said, "you're going off to the lands o'
America.  Well, sir, I've saved ten golden pounds, and
I'm goin' too to tak' care o' Toddie.  No, no, you canna
shake me off."
</p>

<p>
Eean smiled, and Bunko won.
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that when Captain Cawdor, with
Eean and Toddie, took passage at Liverpool for Baltimore,
Bunko was booked also.
</p>

<p>
"Heigho," said Bunko, as soon as they were embarked,
"I can hardly believe I'm no' dreaming.  And we really
<i>are</i> going down to the sea in ships, to behold the
wonders o' the Lord in the mighty deep."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Just one month after the sailing of the steamer that
bore old Eean and his party to the new world, and early
on a beautiful forenoon, Se√±or Sarpinto was lounging in
the gardens of a splendid hotel in San Francisco.  At
such a time of day as this very few people are to be
found lounging anywhere, in this great busy, bustling
city, for those who are not engrossed in the work of
their lives are intent on pleasure.
</p>

<p>
But Sarpinto was an idler to-day, and a dreamer as
well&mdash;that is, if so restless a spirit as his ever could
be idle.
</p>

<p>
He had smoked two or three cigarettes, and lit a
fourth, but presently he threw this away, and throwing
himself back in his chair, allowed his eyes to rest
on a fleecy cloud that was speeding across the blue sky
on the wings of a western breeze.  There was not
another morsel of cloudlet to be seen anywhere.
</p>

<p>
"All alone!  All alone!" he was saying half aloud,
"alone like a ship at sea, or like my own time-tossed
barque of life.  How different, how very different it
would all have been had Helena loved me!  Ay, it is
just seventeen years to-day since I dared my fate, and
in these very gardens too, and not very far from this
spot.  Heigho! how the time flies!  How&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
He had not heard the sound of light footsteps
advancing, nor noted that anyone was near him, till
a sweet soft voice said:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, please sir, can you tell me which is the path
that leads to the gate?  I&mdash;&mdash;."
</p>

<p>
She ceased speaking, and stood before Se√±or
Sarpinto, shy, half-frightened, but wholly surprised.
And well she might be.  For Sarpinto had clutched
the arms of the chair with both hands, and was
bending forward, gazing into her face as one might
who has suddenly awakened from a strange dream.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens! girl," he cried.  "Tell me what or
who you are, and how you came here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir!" Toddie began, "I'm sorry&mdash;I didn't know,
Pray forgive me, sir&mdash;but, ah! here come father and
Captain Cawdor."
</p>

<p>
"O, Daddy!" she shouted, running towards the
group, and forgetting all about Sarpinto.  "I'm so
glad you have come.  I had lost you."
</p>

<p>
"But, my dear child," cried the jolly old captain, "I
do declare you've found your uncle before us."
</p>

<p>
"My uncle?  My uncle Sarpinto, Captain Cawdor!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, lass, and nobody else.  Se√±or Sarpinto, you
got my letters explaining all; and here, my dear sir,
stands your little niece."
</p>

<p>
The Se√±or took a step forward with half-open arms,
and next moment Toddie's head was pillowed on his
breast.  He kissed her brow, then held her at arm's
length, that he might feast his eyes on her rare young
beauty.  The tears came welling up.  He struggled
to suppress them.
</p>

<p>
"How like your mother!" he sighed.
</p>

<p>
Then he kissed her again, and smiled.
</p>

<p>
"We shall all be very happy," he said.  "How
pleased I am to meet you, Mr. Arundel," he continued,
turning now to Eean and shaking hands right heartily.
"But, sir, you are to me no stranger.  Many and many
a night, when frozen up in the southern sea of ice, I
have heard about you, and about Fred Arundel too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he added, looking at Toddie, "and about you,
my dear, also, and your <i>Water Baby</i>, and all about
your adventures on your desert island.  Oh, I assure you,
Carissima, Frank was never tired talking about you."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, sir! oh, uncle! do you think we shall ever see
Fred and Frank again?"
</p>

<p>
"I dreamt we should, mia Carissima, and I have
chartered the sturdy old <i>San Salvador</i> for a cruise in
southern seas to look for them&mdash;for I cannot, will not,
believe them dead&mdash;and to look also for survivors, if
any there be, of my good ship <i>Resolute</i>."
</p>

<p>
Se√±or paused for a moment.  Then, once more turning
to Eean and extending his hand, he said with a
pleasant smile:
</p>

<p>
"Come with me as my guest, friend Arundel, and
bring my niece as well.  There, I will not be denied."
</p>

<p>
"In that case I will not refuse," said Eean, "and I
shall write to my wife to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, your wife shall know all about it in an hour!
I shall cable."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Very much surprised indeed was honest, kindly
Eppie to receive that cablegram all the way from San
Francisco&mdash;over three thousand miles of land, across
three thousand miles and more of ocean.  And the
reply was paid for; so that Eean and Toddie had that
very evening the pleasure of reading Eppie's message
back, and her blessing.
</p>

<p>
And thus then it happened that, when the <i>San
Salvador</i> left the Pacific slope, and once more spread
her canvas wings out before the ocean breeze, on her
ivory-white quarter-deck sat old Eean, the bard, and
Toddie, the latter dressed in the most bewitchingly
yachty costume it is possible to imagine, and looking
every inch a sailor.
</p>

<p>
And not very far off, leaning over the bulwarks, was
Bunko himself, not looking very like a sailor, it must
be confessed, but a well-dressed and interesting figure
nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
Captain Cawdor was in uniform now, and he had
not only the same mate, but pretty much the same
men, as he had sailed into port with more than a year
and a half ago.
</p>

<p>
One other person deserves a word of introduction.
Yonder he is, talking now to Bunko, a Scottish
missionary, one of those fearless young men who take life
in the left hand, the Bible in the other, and carry the
gospel of peace and goodwill to the most savage tribes
on earth.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
South and south sailed the good barque <i>San Salvador</i>,
and every day a new life seemed to be opening out
before Toddie.  Her young heart was full of hope; it
was therefore full of joy, and she seemed to be part
and parcel of all the beauty she saw around her&mdash;beauty
of sea, beauty of sky, beauty of wild wheeling
birds of the ocean wave, and beauty of green islands
that seemed to move and float and flit on the world of
waters, as the ship sailed past them and away&mdash;south,
south, ever south.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br><br>
FIGHTING IN EARNEST.
</h3>

<p>
"And now Frank," said Fred, as the <i>Island
Queen</i> stretched away out into the more
open sea, and the round moon was rising
and casting its silvery rays athwart the
waves, "everything depends upon the wind
holding.  If we get becalmed we'll be
boarded by swarms of those savages, in spite of all
we can do."
</p>

<p>
"I don't think," replied Frank, "that there is much
fear of a calm taking place.  Why, the wind seems to
increase every minute since we have left the shore."
</p>

<p>
"How thankful I am though that we dared all!  Ah,
Frank, old man! there is nothing like a bit of dash."
</p>

<p>
"No; dash does it.  I've always thought so.  First
feel yourself fit, and then do a dash."
</p>

<p>
"That's it, Frank."
</p>

<p>
The poor fellows who had been delivered from
slavery on the island of savages had eaten a hearty
supper, and were now one and all fast asleep.  Even
the Yankee skipper had gone to sleep, with a quid
in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
The breeze in two hours' time had increased to quite
half a gale, and Fred began to grow seriously uneasy.
The little craft was very much deeper in the water
now, for the addition of ten men made a vast difference
in so small a ship.
</p>

<p>
She pitched and rolled to a tremendous extent&mdash;she
took in water over the bows, she shivered and shook
like an old clothes basket when on the top of a wave,
and wallowed when in the trough of the seas.  In fact
she did not behave at all prettily now she was put
fairly on her mettle.
</p>

<p>
By-and-by Fred found it necessary to batten down,
although he had to leave a portion of one hatchway
open, in order to let those below have a sufficiency of
fresh air.
</p>

<p>
Frank relieved Fred about four o'clock, or eight bells
in the middle watch, and feeling completely exhausted,
Fred lashed himself to the mast, covered himself up as
well he could with a piece of canvas, and was soon
fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
He never stirred, nor, knowing his condition, did
Fred permit him to be disturbed until two bells in the
forenoon watch.
</p>

<p>
Though he pretended to be cross with Frank for
having allowed him to oversleep himself, he knew that
his friend Had done all for the best.
</p>

<p>
The wind was still roaring through the rigging; but
had veered round several points, and the yacht was now
close hauled.  Far away astern were the green islands
they had left on the previous night.
</p>

<p>
"Whither away, mate?" said Fred.
</p>

<p>
"'Pon my honour, captain, I haven't the ghost of a
notion."
</p>

<p>
"But you've been steering for the east?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all the watch."
</p>

<p>
"And I guess that's about as near right as a toucher,"
said Silas the skipper.  "'Cause don't you see we're
bound to come among islands o' some kind, and
shiver me if they can be a bit worse than those
we've left."
</p>

<p>
"True enough," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
About five bells that forenoon a heavy sea struck
the <i>Island Queen</i> on the weather quarter, and almost
laid her on her beam ends.
</p>

<p>
She slowly righted, however, but hardly was she
once more on an even keel than there was a shout from
the men below.
</p>

<p>
"We've sprung a leak!"
</p>

<p>
Fred handed the tiller to Silas, and rushed down.
It was only too true.  The water was coming pouring
in, in three different places at the bows.
</p>

<p>
"All hands to bail her out," cried Fred.
</p>

<p>
And the men set merrily enough to work.  Those
below filled calabashes, and handed them to others on
deck to be emptied overboard.
</p>

<p>
They kept the water under for a while.  But it was
soon evident enough she could not float for any length
of time.
</p>

<p>
The question now arose, What was best to be done? and
a consultation was held.
</p>

<p>
"I see nothing for it, young men, except put about
and just run back for them same islands," said Silas.
</p>

<p>
"And beach her?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, but look you here, Frank," continued
Silas.  "I've no great inclination to be crucified alive,
and eaten afterwards.  I'd rather drown, and be done
with it.  So we better beach her at the little island to
the nor'ard.  There is only one landing, and we can
hold that again' all the savages in creation."
</p>

<p>
The skipper's advice was certainly good.  So the
<i>Island Queen</i> was put about.
</p>

<p>
It was sad, disheartening work, but there was no
other chance of life, so Fred never uttered one single
complaining word, and "Heigho!" was all that Frank
said.
</p>

<p>
Towards sundown the savages in Ota's isle must have
been considerably surprised to see the white man's
little ship standing in again towards the land.  But
she disappeared all at once, and in all probability they
imagined she had sunk with all hands.
</p>

<p>
The fact is the <i>Island Queen</i> had got in behind the
island, and was now in comparatively calm water.  But
the poor wee ship that our castaways had been so proud
of was settling down fast.
</p>

<p>
It was an anxious half hour.
</p>

<p>
Every minute they expected she would take the
fatal plunge, and the boat was all ready on deck to
launch, if indeed they were not sucked down with the
yacht.  The land had almost taken the wind out of
their sails.
</p>

<p>
But at long last the clear sandy bottom became
visible all around them, and a big rolling wave carried
them far up on the beach, receded, and left them almost
high and dry.
</p>

<p>
They were safe for one night.  That at least was
certain, for no canoe could live in the sea that was
running outside.
</p>

<p>
Safe for a night.  Yes, perhaps safe for a week; but
as soon as the wind should change, and the waves dash
into the little land-locked bay, the <i>Island Queen</i> would
break up.
</p>

<p>
So no one thought of sleep to-night.  They worked
in the dark by pandanus torch and lantern light, and
even before the moon rose they had landed all the
arms and ammunition, and all the stores as well.
</p>

<p>
The boat was now hauled well up, and the shipwrecked
crew at once set about fortifying their position.
It was a curious little bay, and a curious little beach, not
thirty yards in width, and flanked at each side by dark
frowning rocks, fifty feet high at least.  Away into the
interior the island was densely wooded, and the land
rose into quite a mountain peak, while all around, with
the exception of the little bay, the cliffs rose sheer up
out of the deep, dark sea.
</p>

<p>
A barrier of sand and gravel was speedily thrown
up across the bay just beyond reach of the waves, and
over this they commenced to build a rampart, with a
front that was almost inaccessible towards the sea.
</p>

<p>
Well those poor fellows knew they were working for
dear life, so on they toiled all night long, and far into
the next forenoon, emulating each other in their feats
of strife, and never thinking of either food or drink.
</p>

<p>
But the barricade was completed at last, and little
Cassia-bud, with his friend Hurricane Bob, were set to
watch, while the others retired under the shade of the
trees to obtain rest and enjoy some refreshment.
</p>

<p>
Being entirely worn out by their terrible hardships
and exertions, nearly all slept till far into the day, when,
after another slight meal, a party was detailed to spy
out the resources of the island.
</p>

<p>
It was far better provisioned than they could have
believed possible.  That it had been at one time
inhabited was also evident, for yams were still found
growing, and several wild pigs were seen in the woods.
The wind continued to blow high all that day and
next; but towards night it fell dead calm, and early on
the following morning the enemy's fleet was reported
in sight, and in full force.  This was signalled by a
man on the outlook to those below.
</p>

<p>
By the time breakfast was finished the canoes were
in sight.  Quite a cloud of them there were, with King
Ota himself leading.
</p>

<p>
Now it suddenly occurred to Fred that the enemy
could easily possess itself of the <i>Island Queen</i>, and
thus have a coign of vantage from which to hurl their
spears and other missiles at the fort.  So he called for
volunteers to help him to fire the craft.
</p>

<p>
There were hardly twenty minutes to spare.  Indeed,
they were not sure of even this time.  Quambo sprang
forward; but little Cassia-bud was before him.
</p>

<p>
"You no go," he cried to Fred, "you no go, sah.
Nobody go.  Cassia-bud fire de ship all by hisse'f."
</p>

<p>
"You can, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he cried energetically, "I can, plenty quick."  He
quickly made up a parcel of combustibles, which he
tied knapsack-fashion over his shoulders.  Then, almost
before they could have counted six, the brave little
fellow had scaled the ramparts and disappeared towards
the beach.
</p>

<p>
They next saw him boldly paddling through the surf,
then climbing cat-like over the vessel's bows, and so
along the deck and down the main-hatchway.
</p>

<p>
It was an anxious time now for those on the ramparts.
Every eye was turned at one moment towards the
enemy's quickly approaching fleet, that seemed to near
the bay with startling rapidity, and next towards the
deck of the <i>Island Queen</i>, in momentary expectation of
seeing Cassia-bud re-appear.
</p>

<p>
It appeared a lifetime to Fred since he had gone below.
</p>

<p>
"Stand by now, lads, to give the foremost boats a
volley!" he cried presently.  "Don't throw away a
single shot."
</p>

<p>
Onwards swept the boats.  They were not seventy
yards from the stern of the <i>Island Queen</i> now; but
look, smoke comes curling up from both the fore and
main hatchways, and then Cassia-bud himself appears.
But instead of coming straight over the bows again he
rushes aft, and waves his jacket in proud defiance at
the savage fleet.
</p>

<p>
Those on the ramparts shout to him to come on.  A
shower of spears flies over the decks, and Kashie is
seen leaping forward.  He falls!  He is killed!
</p>

<p>
No; up again, and bounding along through smoke
and flames and flying spears.  Over he leaps, on through
the surf, and next moment he is on the barricade.  A
dozen arms are stretched towards him, and next
moment he is safe and sound.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!" says Fred right fervently.
</p>

<p>
From stem to stern the <i>Island Queen</i> is soon sheeted
in flames, and through the smoke which rolls slowly
seaward the canoes appear.
</p>

<p>
"Give it to them now," cries Fred, "to show them
we're not dead!"
</p>

<p>
A single volley had a startling effect on those sable
warriors.  Instead of advancing with shouts of terror
the foremost rowers threw themselves pell-mell into the
sea, and the other canoes beat a hasty retreat.
</p>

<p>
With a rifle each, Fred, Frank, Quambo, and Mac
now betake themselves to the cliff top.  They want to
prove to those savages that it will be best in future
not to venture within a radius of half a mile at least.
And this they do in the most satisfactory manner
imaginable.
</p>

<p>
Baffled and defeated where he had expected an
easy victory, the greatest king in all the world retires
to his island home, and the coast is once more clear.
</p>

<p>
For five days the savages made no sign, and the
beleaguered garrison occupied itself in strengthening
the position.
</p>

<p>
The main anxiety would soon be want of water.
Not a drop was to be found in the island except one
little trickling rill, that hardly supplied them with a
pint a day each.  And even this might dry up.
</p>

<p>
There was now no moonlight, but every night
sentries were placed all along the ramparts.
</p>

<p>
Early on the morning of the sixth day there was
not a canoe to be seen anywhere on the sea, and so the
men sat down to breakfast cheerfully enough, and even
the sentries, completely off their guard, were chatting
gaily together on the ramparts.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, without a moment's warning, the whole
front of the barricade was found to be alive with
swarming spear-armed savages.
</p>

<p>
Luckily every man's revolver was by his side, but
the fight that now ensued was terrific.  Hand to hand
they fought, savages and whites, till the former
disappeared at last in the same mysterious way they had
come, leaving their dead behind them, and spearing or
clubbing all the wounded lest the whites should torture
them.
</p>

<p>
But where had they come from?  This was easily
explained.  They had approached the island under
cover of the darkness, and arranged their canoes close
under the rocks, and thus out of sight.  As soon as
this was discovered they were speedily dislodged by the
simple expedient of hurling down stones, and as soon
as they had put out to sea rifles were once more
brought to bear on them.
</p>

<p>
But by placing sentinels at night here and there on
the cliff top no such ruse was again possible.
</p>

<p>
In this battle the garrison lost two men killed, and
had three wounded.
</p>

<p>
One day Cassia-bud returned from the rock with an
empty calibash.  The water had given out.  Then the
sufferings of those unhappy men began in earnest.
</p>

<p>
The cocoanut supply still held out, however, but the
water at last failed to quench the thirst, and the men
began to fall sick.
</p>

<p>
The three wounded men died, and so weak were the
others that they could not bury them.  All they could
do was to drag them to the cliff top and let them roll
over into the sea&mdash;unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br><br>
"WOULD SHE SEE THEIR SIGNALS?"
</h3>

<p>
With the exception of Quambo, Cassia-bud,
and Fred himself, not a soul could walk or
even creep at last.  Their tongues, their
very faces, were swollen, their voices were
reduced to the hoarsest of whispers, and
their red eye-balls burned like fire.
</p>

<p>
Death was staring everyone in the face, when one
morning Hurricane Bob, the faithful dog, was seen
coming bounding joyfully from the bush.
</p>

<p>
He shook himself, and water flew in a shower from
his jacket.
</p>

<p>
"Get the calabash," cried Fred.  "Quick, Quambo,
quick.  Go on, good dog.  Find it, boy.  Find the
water, lad."
</p>

<p>
The honest fellow gave one quick sharp bark and
trotted off in front, the rest following as quickly as
they could.  He led them straight to a rock in the
midst of a wood, and here, pushing a bush aside, he
disappeared entirely.  It was a cave, and in the centre
thereof was a large pool, clear, cool, and sparkling.
</p>

<p>
Then down beside the cave's mouth knelt Fred, his
arm across the great dog's neck, and there and then,
with uplifted, tearful eyes, returned thanks to heaven.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The garrison was now snatched from the very brink
of the grave.
</p>

<p>
But greater joy was to come, for on the very next
day, behold, bearing down towards their island, a
stately barque under full sail.
</p>

<p>
Would she see their signals, their frantic signals?
Yes, she does, and seems to understand them too.  She
alters her course, and bears right down towards the
bay, and lets go her anchor.  And not till then did
they discover that the vessel was none other than the
good ship <i>San Salvador</i>.
</p>

<p>
Surely such joy as those poor fellows exhibited when
the boat landed on the beach, and honest Captain
Cawdor and Se√±or Sarpinto leapt on shore, was never
before, witnessed.
</p>

<p>
You see they were all in a very weak and exhausted
condition, so they wept and laughed by turns, and
even sang and danced for joy, till the tears rose up in
Captain Cawdor's eyes, and even Sarpinto was fain to
turn away his head to hide his emotion.
</p>

<p>
But when Fred and Frank got on board at last, and
found Eean and Toddie there, to say nothing of Bunko,
then indeed their cup of joy was full, and in the bliss
of that meeting they felt rewarded for all the dangers,
trials, and sufferings they had gone through.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In less than a week both Frank and Fred had
recovered their strength, and so had all the others.
</p>

<p>
All this time they had lain at anchor in the bay off
King Ota's island, endeavouring to re-establish friendly
relations with that mighty potentate.
</p>

<p>
He was dead set against them, however.  He would
not trust the white man, nor would he receive any
presents or favours from him.  When boats' crews
were landed, they found only a deserted shore, with no
one to hold a palaver with; for King Ota and his fierce
spearmen, afraid that revenge was sought for, and
dreading the terrible fire-sticks of the pale warriors,
had sought the deepest shades of their forests, and
climbed for safety into the highest hills.
</p>

<p>
So the ship left Ota's shores, and sailed away to
another island some miles to the westward.  This was
a very much larger one, and looked even more prolific
and beautiful than Ota's.
</p>

<p>
Here they were more successful.  Although the
canoes held aloof for a time, yet by a display of kindness,
and by sending them presents, which had first to be
left on the beach, the savages became gradually more
and more bold.  At last the king himself paid the ship
a visit.  He came unarmed and almost alone, explaining
to the captain through Quambo that he knew the
white men were all-powerful, and that if they chose
to slay him they could find him wherever he happened
to hide.
</p>

<p>
His majesty marvelled very much at all he saw,
especially at the firearms and the telescope.  When
invited to look through this at his distant palace on
the hills, he did so with fear and even superstitious
dread.  Why yonder squatted his favourite wife in
front of the palace door, so very near that he could
apparently almost touch her and talk to her!
</p>

<p>
And Captain Cawdor made him a gift of one of
these telescopes, or magic glasses as he called them,
fixing it for him at the right focus.
</p>

<p>
The king got even chatty and garrulous at last; and
when Fred made him look through the glass with the
wrong end towards him, and he saw his wife reduced
in size to a mere midget, and so very far away, his
merriment was as boisterous as that of an infant-school-boy.
</p>

<p>
He had plenty to eat and drink on board, and went
away at last dressed in a scarlet robe&mdash;it really was a
spare dressing-gown of Se√±or Sarpinto's&mdash;and loaded
with presents.  I do not believe there was a happier
king in all the South Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
The men of the <i>San Salvador</i> could now go on shore
without fear of molestation, and all but unarmed.
</p>

<p>
One day the king brought his queen on board, and
Toddie presided at the tea-table on the quarter-deck.
There was chocolate as well as tea, and it was a good
thing there was, for as soon as the queen had taken a
huge gulp of tea she found she did not like the flavour
of it; so she simply gaped, and it all ran out again
over her robe of cocoa-fibre.  But she liked the cocoa,
and passed her cup fifteen times in succession, for
Cassia-bud assured Fred he had counted every cup.
</p>

<p>
And Toddie, with an armed escort under the charge
of Frank and Fred, went next day to visit the king's
kraal.  The view from the doorway was truly superb.
All the rich and fertile island, with its flowering trees,
with its orange groves and waving cocoa-nut and
banana plantations, its woods and waters, its silvery
shores and the bright blue sea itself, patched here and
there with opal or green, lay down below at their feet;
and up here, so high was the hill, a cool and delightful
breeze was blowing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh," cried Toddie, "I think I should like to stay
here for ever and ever!"
</p>

<p>
When Quambo translated this remark of Toddie's to
the king, that potentate gallantly offered to club, cook,
and eat his queen that Toddie might reign in her stead.
And Toddie, the little witch, nodded smilingly to him,
and assured him, through the interpreter, that she
would "ask mamma."
</p>

<p>
This king was asked his opinion of Ota.  He gave
it very brusquely indeed, and in two or three words.
</p>

<p>
"He is an old woman, only fit to pound bread-fruit."
</p>

<p>
On the beach a day or two after this Toddie and her
guard were assembled to see a review of the cannibal
warriors, and a very fearful sight she thought it.  The
review was followed by a warrior dance, with wild,
unearthly music from tom-toms and conch-shells, and
then there was a great bonfire at night, with another
dance around this.
</p>

<p>
Toddie dreamt about what she had seen all night long.
</p>

<p>
However, complete amity was secured with these
people, and so much were they trusted that when the
ship sailed away on a visit to the Isle of Good Hope,
Quambo, the missionary, Bunko, and a party of whites
were left with the king to show him how to build
better huts or houses.
</p>

<p>
Toddie's delight on arriving at the Isle of Good
Hope knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
When she stood on the beach and gazed around her
at the bay with its peaceful waters, the waves breaking
with low and mournful boom on the reef outside, the
feathery cocoanut palms stirred by the breeze, the
flowery pandanus groves, the little cottage, with its
rustic porch and its walks of silvery sand, across which
the wild flowers were now trailing, she smiled and
sighed, and tears filled her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how romantic!" she said, "and yet how
mournful!"  "Still," she added, "I think I should have liked
the life."
</p>

<p>
"Had you been here," said Frank gallantly, "had
you been here, Toddie, perhaps we should not have
been in such a hurry to leave."
</p>

<p>
They spent the whole day in wandering through the
forest, and on their return they found dinner ready in
the little cottage, cooked by little Cassia-bud, just as it
used to be when Fred and Frank were Crusoes.
</p>

<p>
When the sun began to get very low in the western
horizon, they left the island in the <i>Salvador's</i> boat, and
were rowed towards the gap.
</p>

<p>
During a lull in the conversation, and as the boat
was speeding over the placid lake, "Oh, Miss Toddie,"
said Cassia-bud, "hab massa Fred told you ob de big
debbil-fish that fly ober de boat, and hab nuffin on but
his head?"
</p>

<p>
Fred had not told her, and very much puzzled she
was; but when Frank explained all about this debbil-fish,
and the fright they had when it flew over the reef,
she laughed right merrily.
</p>

<p>
"I think," said Eean, "there must have been a good
deal of mystery as well as romance about this island of
yours, Frank and Fred.  I suppose you are half sorry
you are leaving it."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite half, sir," said Frank, "and yet we spent
some very pleasant days here.  Didn't we, Fred?"
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
The party next visited the little coral reef island
and once again Toddie was told the story of the strange
and wonderful mirage, which had so nearly cost our
heroes their lives.
</p>

<p>
When, after an absence of some days, they returned
to the islands, they found that matters had progressed
very pleasantly indeed.  The king was delighted with
the huts which the white men had thrown up for him,
and still more delighted with a little church which had
been built.
</p>

<p>
This king, savage though he certainly was, possessed
a good deal of common-sense, and over and over again
he had asked the missionary to explain why he seemed
to take so much interest in his people.  What did he
expect in return?
</p>

<p>
He could understand, he said, white men coming to
his island to trade.  They brought one thing and they
took away another.  But this man, this missionary,
wanted to do all for the islanders, yet receive nothing
in return.  Was he a true man, or did he harbour some
deep-laid scheme against the king and his people, which
he was skilfully trying to hide?
</p>

<p>
The answer to all this was not easily understood by
this savage people.  But to the best of his ability, and
with the aid of the two savages who had been so faithful
and so true all along, he told them all the gospel
story, and then he in his turn put a question to the
king.  "If," said the missionary, "the Saviour of
mankind, and Son of the Lord of all, could give his life
for us, was it any marvel that he&mdash;the missionary&mdash;a
mere human being and mortal, should humbly try to
follow in the great Master's footsteps, and do all he
could for the salvation of these islanders?"  The
missionary triumphed.
</p>

<p>
That which never, never, could have been effected by
the sword and force, was easily accomplished by one
man, Bible in hand.
</p>

<p>
When the <i>San Salvador</i> was ready to start away
on her homeward voyage it did not seem at all strange
that the missionary should express his desire to remain
here, or that Quambo, Magilvray, and five other white
men resolved to keep him company.  But when Bunko
came up to Eean on the quarter-deck, and said:
</p>

<p>
"This is my home now, kind master.  There's many
and many a poor, dark soul in this island I can do
some good for.  Bunko hasna the gift o' tongues.  He
canna preach the Word, but he can act it."
</p>

<p>
Then, I say, the old bard marvelled not a little, but
he took the young man's hand kindly in his, and
replied:
</p>

<p>
"Yes, lad, you can act it, and example is better
than precept.  Stay, my friend, stay.  We are sorry to
lose you; but as you think you can do good we
will not gainsay you.  Farewell, and God bless you,
Bunko."
</p>

<p>
And as the ship sailed away from the island the last
figure seen was Bunko's, standing on a knoll, waving
his bonnet in the air, till the <i>San Salvador</i> passed round
a wooded cape, and they saw him no more.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Five years have passed away.  Five years!  What
changes a space of time, even of this brief span, may
work in the lives of all!  Think of it, boys of fifteen.
Why, in five years' time you will be men, and must ere
then have chosen your career in life for better or for
worse.
</p>

<p>
Five years!  But they have been busy ones with
Fred and Frank.  They have not been at home all that
time, you may be sure.  No, for Se√±or Sarpinto, restless
ever, saw fit to return to those islands, and in a much
larger and finer ship, of which the young sailors were
chief officers.
</p>

<p>
From San Francisco he took out with him a colony
of busy bees of Americans, with everything necessary
to develop the resources of those cannibal islands.
They are cannibal islands now no longer.  A church
stands on the largest, where once dreadful orgies used
to take place, that are too revolting even to think of.
There is a busy and prosperous little village near the
sea, and fields of rice and roots and sugar-cane stretch
over the rolling hills far away to the woodlands.  The
islands are rich too in spices and in gums, as well as
some forms of mineral wealth, and ships call many
times during the year to buy and barter goods.
</p>

<p>
The black population is industrious, the white men
and their families are well-to-do.  Fred is governor,
and honest Bunko is his overseer.
</p>

<p>
But of all professions in the world what should
Frank adopt in the end but farming?
</p>

<p>
I will tell you how it turned out.  Se√±or Sarpinto,
after a visit to the little village of Methlin, was so
enamoured with the quiet peace and repose that reign
around it, and with the simple ways of the fisher
population, that he determined to make it his home.
He was growing old, he said, and he should like to be
near to Toddie.  He had plenty of money, he told Eean.
What was the good of money if it did not bring
happiness?  So he set about "building himself
happiness"&mdash;these are his own words.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost he found out his old friend,
Captain Cawdor, who had retired, and was living in
the city of Glasgow.
</p>

<p>
"My good captain," he said, "I cannot understand
why you should like to live among stones and mortar,
quite away from the sound of the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! my friend, I'd fain spend my life, or what
remains of it, where I could hear and see the waves;
but I am not wealthy enough to do as I please."
</p>

<p>
"But the rent you pay for this house," said the
Se√±or, "would, I think, get you a charming villa
surrounded by pretty gardens, close to the woods, and
close to the western ocean."
</p>

<p>
"When you find such a place, my friend, come and
tell me, and I will rejoicingly take it," the captain said,
laughing.
</p>

<p>
Now there was land to be sold at Methlin, and
around it, and the Se√±or quickly became the purchaser,
and in six months' time not only did a lovely mansion
spring up in the glen behind the village, but a pretty
cottage close to the sea.
</p>

<p>
In the former soon dwelt the Se√±or Sarpinto, and in
the latter, who but Captain Cawdor; and one of the
largest wings of the Se√±or's house was given to Frank,
on condition that he should farm the Se√±or's land on a
handsome salary.
</p>

<p>
Frank was very happy now, and his altered circumstances
in life gave him an opportunity of taking care
of his mother, who still resided in town, but was
getting old.
</p>

<p>
Yes, it was a strange freak of Fortune to make
Frank a farmer.  After this no one would be surprised
to know that Cassia-bud left the sea also, after
officiating as steward for some years, and became
butler to Se√±or Sarpinto at Helena House.
</p>

<p>
One day, about the end of the five years, Frank and
Toddie might have been seen walking together on the
beach near the igloo, or the house that Bunko had
built with the skeleton of the Johnnie Whale.  They
seem in very earnest conversation indeed.  It would
be obviously unkind, however, for me to play the
eaves-dropper; but one thing I do know, and must
tell the reader.  Just six weeks after that earnest
conversation at the igloo a very interesting event was
the subject of general conversation among the
villagers&mdash;the marriage of Miss Arundel.  And every one
confessed that a more beautiful bride than Toddie never
was seen, nor a more handsome and manly bridegroom
than Frank Fielding.
</p>

<p>
Fred happened to be at home at the time, and the
marriage was celebrated in the fisherman's humble
cot.
</p>

<p>
Before stepping into the carriage that awaited the
happy pair at the door, Frank held out his hand, and
right heartily did Fred Arundel grasp and press it.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers yet," said Frank.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers ever," said Fred.
</p>

<p>
And so they parted.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Alone in his romantic cave Eean, the bard, still writes
his charming verses, still sings his wild lays, soothed
by moan of wind and murmur of sea; there has come
a peace and repose to the mind of the Se√±or Sarpinto
he had never known before; old Captain Cawdor is
very contented, and very jolly too, in his cottage by
the sea.  And oftentimes, on summer evenings, may the
trio be seen strolling together on the beach, or when
the wild wintry winds are raving through the woods,
seated perhaps round Eean's cottage hearth with Eppie
near by, birr-birr-ing at her wheel.
</p>

<p>
And many a reminiscence is theirs to tell of their
strange eventful lives, and of dangers gone through by
